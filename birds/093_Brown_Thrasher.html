Brown Thrashers wear a somewhat severe expression thanks to their heavy, slightly downcurved bill and staring yellow eyes, and they are the only thrasher species east of Texas. Brown Thrashers are exuberant singers, with one of the largest repertoires of any North American songbird.</p></div></div><div class="row"><ul class="LH-menu"><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Brown_Thrasher/lifehistory#habitat"><span>Habitat</span><span>Scrub</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Brown_Thrasher/lifehistory#food"><span>Food</span><span>Omnivore</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Brown_Thrasher/lifehistory#nesting"><span>Nesting</span><span>Shrub</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Brown_Thrasher/lifehistory#behavior"><span>Behavior</span><span>Ground Forager</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Brown_Thrasher/lifehistory#conservation"><span>Conservation</span><span>Low Concern</span></a></li></ul></div></div>

                    <div><h3>Size & Shape</h3><p>Brown Thrashers are fairly large, slender songbirds with long proportions—the legs are long and sturdy, and the bill is long and slightly downcurved. The tail is long, too, and often cocked upward in the manner of wrens.</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Color Pattern</h3><p>Brown Thrashers are foxy brown birds with heavy, dark streaking on their whitish underparts. The face is gray-brown and the wings show two black-and-white wingbars. They have bright-yellow eyes.</p></div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior</h3><p>Brown Thrashers skulk in shrubby tangles or forage on the ground below dense cover. They’re most obvious when they sing their loud songs from shrubs and treetops. The song is a complex string of many musical phrases (many copied from other birds’ songs, with each phrase typically sung twice before moving on). They also make a distinctive, harsh <em>tsuck</em> note.</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat</h3><p>Scrubby fields, dense regenerating woods, and forest edges are the primary habitats of Brown Thrashers. They rarely venture far from thick undergrowth into which they can easily retreat.</p></div>
                </div>
                
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Regional Differences</h3><p>Brown Thrashers from the western Great Plains are slightly larger and paler than those breeding farther east. </p></div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat (det)</h3>In eastern North America, Brown Thrashers nest in thickets, hedgerows, forest edges, and overgrown clearings in deciduous forest. Farther west, in the Great Plains, they breed in fencerows, shelterbelts, and woody draws. They’re often found in woodlands with cottonwood, willow, dogwood, American plum, saltcedar, hawthorn, pitch pine, or scrub oak. On rare occasions they breed in backyards and gardens. Brown Thrashers winter in the southern part of their breeding range and also move into nonbreeding habitat throughout central Texas. They are the only thrasher east of the Rocky Mountains and central Texas.</div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Food</h3>Brown Thrashers eat mostly insects and other arthropods along with some fruits, seeds, and nuts. They typically feed on the ground, sweeping their bills through the leaf litter and soil with quick, sideways motions. They also forage in clusters of dead leaves on trees, eat fruit right off of berry bushes, glean seeds from weed stems, and sometimes catch insects in the air. The animal portion of their diet includes many kinds of beetles, along with grubs, wire-worms, army worms, cutworms, tent caterpillars, gypsy-moth caterpillars, leafhoppers, treehoppers, cicadas, grasshoppers, crickets, wasps, bees, harvestmen, sowbugs, lizards, snakes, and tree frogs. The fruit portion of their diet includes blueberry, huckleberry, holly, elderberries, pokeberries, hackberries, Virginia creeper, sour gum, bayberry, sumac, raspberry, currant, grape, cherry, and strawberry.</div>
                    <div><h3>Nesting</h3>The male and female both help select the nest site, usually low in a tree or thorny shrub. They use forsythia, privet, gooseberry, sumac, Osage-orange, multiflora rose, eastern redcedar, elm, and honey locust. Occasionally they nest right on the ground.<br></div>

                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior (det.)</h3>Brown Thrashers spend most of their time near or on the ground, walking, running, or hopping. When disturbed at the nest, they drop to the ground and dart into dense cover. They feed by sweeping their long bills through leaf litter to uncover insects and other invertebrates. They are slow, short-distance fliers with a distinctive jerky, fluttering flight style. Brown Thrashers are monogamous during a breeding season, but it isn’t known whether pairs stay together from year to year. They breed in such dense vegetation that little is known of their courtship; the few observations that exist suggest that a courting pair presents each other with twigs or dead leaves, after which the male may briefly chase the female before mating. They defend territories of variable size, and they are very aggressive toward intruding Brown Thrashers and toward potential nest predators, which include snakes (racers as well as garter, king, rat, bull, and milk snakes) and dogs. Sometimes Brown Thrashers strike predators with their bills hard enough to draw blood.</div>
                    <div><h3>Conservation</h3>Brown Thrashers are fairly common birds but their numbers have been declining for the last several decades. According to the North American Breeding Bird Survey, between 1966 and 2015 populations declined by 41%. Partners in Flight estimates the global breeding population at 4.9 million, with 100% spending some part of the year in the U.S., and 8% breeding in Canada. They rate an 11 out of 20 on the Continental Concern Score and are not on the </div>
