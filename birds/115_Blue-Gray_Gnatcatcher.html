It hops and sidles in dense outer foliage, foraging for insects and spiders. As it moves, this steely blue-gray bird conspicuously flicks its white-edged tail from side to side, scaring up insects and chasing after them. Pairs use spiderweb and lichens to build small, neat nests, which sit on top of branches and look like tree knots.</p></div></div><div class="row"><ul class="LH-menu"><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Blue-gray_Gnatcatcher/lifehistory#habitat"><span>Habitat</span><span>Forests</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Blue-gray_Gnatcatcher/lifehistory#food"><span>Food</span><span>Insects</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Blue-gray_Gnatcatcher/lifehistory#nesting"><span>Nesting</span><span>Tree</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Blue-gray_Gnatcatcher/lifehistory#behavior"><span>Behavior</span><span>Foliage Gleaner</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Blue-gray_Gnatcatcher/lifehistory#conservation"><span>Conservation</span><span>Low Concern</span></a></li></ul></div></div>

                    <div><h3>Size & Shape</h3><p>Blue-gray Gnatcatchers are tiny, slim songbirds with long legs; a long tail; and a thin, straight bill.</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Color Pattern</h3><p>Blue-gray Gnatcatchers are pale blue-gray birds with grayish-white underparts and a mostly black tail with white edges. The underside of the tail is mostly white. The face is highlighted by a thin but obvious white eyering. In summer, male Blue-gray Gnatcatchers sport a black ‘V’ on their foreheads extending above their eyes.</p></div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior</h3><p>The energetic Blue-gray Gnatchatcher rarely slows down, fluttering after small insects among shrubs and trees with its tail cocked at a jaunty angle. Blue-gray Gnatcatchers often take food from spiderwebs and also abscond with strands of webbing for their tiny nests, which are shaped like tree knots. </p></div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat</h3><p>In the East, gnatcatchers breed in deciduous forests and near edges, often in moister areas. In the West, look for them in shorter woodlands and shrublands including pinyon-juniper and oak woodlands. </p></div>
                </div>
                
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Regional Differences</h3><p>Blue-gray Gnatcatchers from the Rocky Mountains and westward are generally drabber than gnatcatchers of the East. Western females tend to have a brownish cast to their upperparts and summer males have a shorter and wider black forehead “V.” They also show black at the base of the underside of the tail, unlike the eastern birds’ entirely white underside to the closed tail. The calls and particularly the songs of the two forms differ as well.</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat (det)</h3>Blue-gray Gnatcatchers nest and forage in a broad range of wooded habitats across their extensive breeding range. Although they shun coniferous forests lacking rich understory growth, they use a range of broadleaf and mixed woodlands from chaparral to mature forests. They prefer moist areas, often near habitat edges. In the northernmost parts of their range, they nest along rivers and streams or near lakes, particularly in ash, maple, and oak forests. In the Southwest, oak and pinon-juniper woodlands, chaparral, and willow and cottonwood woodlands near water all provide habitat. Throughout the south-central and mid-Altantic states, they claim territories in upland broadleaf and mixed forests as well as along streams and rivers. Farther south, they add swamp forests and pine flatwoods with oak understory. They favor the edges of forest gaps, so extensive patch-cut logging can provide abundant habitat. Their winter habitats are similarly various from region to region, and may include cypress swamps, citrus orchards, mangroves, savannah with scattered groves, and a range of woodlands from sea level swamp forests to highland oaks. </div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Food</h3>Blue-gray Gnatcatchers eat small insects, spiders, and other invertebrates. Prey species vary across their extensive range. In the Southwest, for example, prey include treehoppers, froghoppers, leaf hoppers, plant bugs, tree bugs, leaf beetles, weevils, wolf spiders, caterpillars, and grasshoppers. In the Northeast, adult and larval moths can provide up to half of prey taken. The smallest prey are swallowed alive. The wings are torn off larger prey and their bodies beaten on a perch prior to being eaten. Parents generally feed the young these same foods, offering progressively larger whole prey as the chicks mature. </div>
                    <div><h3>Nesting</h3>Male and female jointly choose a nest site, usually in a live broadleaf tree in a less dense bit of their territory. Nests are built well out on side limbs, often saddled against a side branch or around a twig or knot for support. Nests tend to be higher than the midpoint of the tree.<br></div>

                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior (det.)</h3>The Blue-gray Gnatcatcher is a busy forager. It flits through dense outer foliage, hops and sidles along branches, peering with quick head movements to glean small insects and spiders. Flashing the white edges of their long tail may help them flush prey, which they then snap up while the gnatcatcher is perched, hovering, or sallying into the air after them. Pairs bond quickly on the breeding ground, with the male's initial aggression toward intruders softening as he leads the female around the territory. They explore possible nesting sites together, with one or the other occasionally mimicking nest-building. These gnatcatchers are pugnacious defenders of their territories, attacking much larger birds as well as intruding neighbors. Adults mob potential predators with other small birds. The male and female of a pair often cooperate in challenging an interloper. The male's soft territorial songs and the female's aggressive calls quickly turning to extended chase, usually by the male. More intense aggression involves soaring aerial confrontation and bill snapping, and even prolonged grappling on the ground. Although the female does most of the brooding, the male shares nest-building, incubation, and the feeding of nestlings and fledglings. While there seems to be little predation on adults, nestlings and eggs are taken by jays, magpies, and woodpeckers, and probably by snakes, crows, grackles, raccoons, squirrels, and chipmunks. </div>
                    <div><h3>Conservation</h3>Blue-gray Gnatcatchers are numerous and their overall populations have been stable and slightly increased between 1966 and 2014, according to the North American Breeding Bird Survey. Growth appears to have been particularly strong in the West. Partners in Flight estimates a global breeding population of 160 million, with 74% spending some part of the year in the U.S. and 65% in Mexico. They rate a 7 out of 10 on the Continental Concern Score and are not on the </div>
