You’re most likely to see one prowling above a forest edge or field using just a few stiff wingbeats followed by a glide. With their smaller lookalike, the Sharp-shinned Hawk, Cooper’s Hawks make for famously tricky identifications. Both species are sometimes unwanted guests at bird feeders, looking for an easy meal (but not one of sunflower seeds).</p></div></div><div class="row"><ul class="LH-menu"><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Coopers_Hawk/lifehistory#habitat"><span>Habitat</span><span>Forests</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Coopers_Hawk/lifehistory#food"><span>Food</span><span>Birds</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Coopers_Hawk/lifehistory#nesting"><span>Nesting</span><span>Tree</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Coopers_Hawk/lifehistory#behavior"><span>Behavior</span><span>Aerial Forager</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Coopers_Hawk/lifehistory#conservation"><span>Conservation</span><span>Low Concern</span></a></li></ul></div></div>

                    <div><h3>Size & Shape</h3><p>A medium-sized hawk with the classic accipiter shape: broad, rounded wings and a very long tail. In Cooper’s Hawks, the head often appears large, the shoulders broad, and the tail rounded.</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Color Pattern</h3><p>Adults are steely blue-gray above with warm reddish bars on the underparts and thick dark bands on the tail. Juveniles are brown above and crisply streaked with brown on the upper breast, giving them a somewhat hooded look compared with young Sharp-shinned Hawks' more diffuse streaking.</p></div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior</h3><p>Look for Cooper’s Hawks to fly with a flap-flap-glide pattern typical of accipiters. Even when crossing large open areas they rarely flap continuously. Another attack maneuver is to fly fast and low to the ground, then up and over an obstruction to surprise prey on the other side.</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat</h3><p>Wooded habitats from deep forests to leafy subdivisions and backyards.</p></div>
                </div>
                
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Regional Differences</h3><p>Cooper’s Hawks from western North America are substantially smaller (weighing around one-fifth less) than birds in the East.</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat (det)</h3>Cooper’s Hawks are forest and woodland birds, but our leafy suburbs seem nearly as good. These lanky hawks are a regular sight in parks, quiet neighborhoods, over fields, at backyard feeders, and even along busy streets if there are trees around.</div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Food</h3>Cooper’s Hawks mainly eat birds. Small birds are safer around Cooper’s Hawks than medium-sized birds: studies list European Starlings, Mourning Doves, and Rock Pigeons as common targets along with American Robins, several kinds of jays, Northern Flicker, and quail, pheasants, grouse, and chickens. Cooper’s Hawks sometimes rob nests and also eat chipmunks, hares, mice, squirrels, and bats. Mammals are more common in diets of Cooper’s Hawks in the West.</div>
                    <div><h3>Nesting</h3>Cooper’s Hawks build nests in pines, oaks, Douglas-firs, beeches, spruces, and other tree species, often on flat ground rather than hillsides, and in dense woods. Nests are typically 25-50 feet high, often about two-thirds of the way up the tree in a crotch or on a horizontal branch.<br></div>

                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior (det.)</h3>Cooper’s Hawks show the classic accipiter flight style: a few stiff wingbeats followed by short glides. But in pursuit of prey their flight becomes powerful, quick, and very agile, allowing the bird to thread its way through tree branches at top speed. Courting birds display by flying with slow wingbeats, then gliding with wings held in a V. Males make a bowing display to females after pairing and before beginning to build the nest.</div>
                    <div><h3>Conservation</h3>Cooper's Hawk populations appear to have been stable between 1966 and 2015, according to the North American Breeding Bird Survey. Partners in Flight estimates a breeding population of 700,000, with 89% spending at least some part of the year in the U.S., 22% in Mexico, and 8% breeding in Canada. The species rates an 7 out of 20 on the Continental Concern Score. Cooper's Hawk is not on the </div>
