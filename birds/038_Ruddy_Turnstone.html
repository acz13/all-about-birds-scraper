                    <div><h3>Size & Shape</h3><p>The Ruddy Turnstone is a short, stocky, and oval-shaped shorebird. They have a stout and slightly upturned bill. </p></div>
                    <div><h3>Color Pattern</h3><p>Breeding males have unique black-and-white markings on the head and throat and a chestnut and black variegated (calico catlike) pattern on the back. Breeding females are paler than males. Nonbreeding adults have brown ghosting of the breeding plumage pattern. Juveniles look similar to nonbreeding birds, but have rusty edges to the feathers. All Ruddy Turnstones have orange legs, but they are brighter during the breeding season. In flight, Ruddy Turnstones show a unique color pattern: white stripe down the back, black tail stripe, white rump, and white stripe down the wings. </p></div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior</h3><p>Ruddy Turnstones flip rocks, pebbles, and seaweed along shorelines in search of food. They rarely wade in waters more than a few inches deep, generally foraging out of the water where the surf deposits shells, rocks, and seaweed. During migration and on the wintering grounds they gather in groups of 10 to over 1,000. </p></div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat</h3><p>Ruddy Turnstones breed in the tundra of northern North America. But many nonbreeding birds also hang around the coastal shores in the lower 48 even in the summer. During migration they use freshwater shorelines, mudflats, rocky shorelines, and sandy beaches. On the wintering grounds they occur along coastal areas with mudflats, sandy beaches, and rocky shores. </p></div>

                    <div><h3>Regional Differences</h3>None</div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat (det)</h3>Ruddy Turnstones breed along rocky coasts and in the tundra across the High Arctic. In North America they breed in sparsely vegetated tundra near marshes, streams, and ponds. During migration they stop along coastal rocky and sandy beaches, mudflats, and shorelines of freshwater lakes to refuel. On their wintering grounds they congregate along rocky shorelines, mudflats, deltas, and sandy beaches. </div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Food</h3><p>Ruddy Turnstones feed primarily on adult and larval flies and midges during the breeding season. They uncover their prey by flipping over rocks, pebbles, shells, or seaweed with their stout, slightly upturned bills. They also eat spiders, beetles, bees, and wasps. During the nonbreeding season they have a more diverse diet, eating everything from small crustaceans, to mollusks, to bird eggs. If they come across an unattended gull or tern nest they readily break open the eggs and eat the contents. They also pick at dead fish and mammals that wash up on the shores in early summer when insects have yet to emerge.</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Nesting</h3>Male and female Ruddy Turnstones explore potential nest sites within the maleâ€™s territory. Both make small scrapes in the ground with their bodies, but the female chooses the nesting location. Once she finds a spot, she makes a scrape, typically at the edge of tundra vegetation near a wet area and out of the wind. At other times she makes a scrape on bare gravel or in sand barrens. <br></div>

                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior (det.)</h3>Ruddy Turnstones strut along beaches and rocky shorelines stopping occasionally to flip rocks, seaweed, or other debris with their stout slightly upturned bill to look for insects and small crustaceans hidden beneath. They are strong fliers and speed past making sharp turns like many other shorebirds. Pairs are monogamous and territorial on the breeding grounds, often returning to the same area to mate with the same individual year after year. Upon arrival they face each other with ruffled feathers while calling and spreading their tails. After the initial face off, the male flies with slow and steady wingbeats around the territory and lands with head pushed forward, back feathers ruffled, and tail spread. After the display he follows the female everywhere, rarely standing more than 30 feet from her. Soon after, they begin looking for a place to nest. Most females lay eggs within 7 days of their arrival on the breeding grounds. In order to do this, they need to eat as much as they can as soon as they arrive. The female does most of the incubating while the male stands guard nearby, incubating on occasion. After the chicks hatch, territorial boundaries break down and families move to areas with abundant insects. Eggs and young are vulnerable to predation by Long-tailed and Parasitic jaegers, Glaucous Gulls, and foxes. When parents sense an approaching predator the male flies at the intruder while alarm calling. Upon hearing the alarm calls the female walks away from the nest to mislead the predator, and takes flight once she is far enough away from the nest. Like other shorebirds, turnstones migrate in stages. The first to leave the breeding grounds are birds that did not successfully breed, followed by females, males, and finally juvenile birds hatched that year. During migration they congregate in large groups and fly in unison to feed along rocky coasts, estuaries, rocky beaches, and sandy beaches. </div>
                    <div><h3>Conservation</h3>Ruddy Turnstones are common and widespread, but their remote breeding grounds make it hard to estimate population trends, especially since numbers tend to fluctuate naturally from year to year. The North American breeding population was estimated at 267,000 in 1999; in 2006 it was 8% lower, at 245,000. A separate study estimated a 77% decline in the number of birds detected at Delaware Bay between 1988 and 2007. It has been reported that counts on the coast of North America declined substantially between the 1980s and 2011, indicating that the population size could be lower than the 2006 estimate. Ruddy Turnstones rate an 11 out of 20 on the Continental Concern Score and are not on the </div>
