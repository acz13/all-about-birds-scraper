These restless birds flock up by the hundreds in winter, scattering across Canada and the United States. Snow Buntings breed in the high Arctic among rocky crevices where their crisp white plumage blends in with the snowy landscape. In the winter they acquire rusty tones that help them blend in with their winter homes of bare ground and crop stubble. </p>

</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Color Pattern</h3><p><p>Snow Buntings have several plumages, but they always show white inner wings with black wingtips and a black-and-white tail. Breeding males are sharp white with a black back. Breeding females are whitish overall with a brown, streaky back and a dusky head. Nonbreeding males are white below with rusty patches on the crown, "ear," and shoulder, and dark streaks down the back. Nonbreeding females have a rusty wash on the face and darker rusty patches on the breast. Breeding males and females have a dark bill that turns yellowish orange during the nonbreeding season. </p>
</p></div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior</h3><p><p>Walks along barren places with a hunched-over posture, easily blending in with the ground, until the group takes flight in a burst of black and white. Forms large flocks often with Horned Larks and longspurs during the nonbreeding season.</p>
</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat</h3><p><p>Breeds on rocky tundra. Winters in open weedy and grassy fields and along shores of lakes and oceans. Often concentrates on shorelines where debris piles up along the edge from wave or wind action. </p>
</p></div>

                    <div><h3>Regional Differences</h3>None</div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat (det)</h3><p>Snow Buntings spend the summer in the arctic tundra, nesting in rocky areas and foraging in patches of sedges and other vegetation. In the winter they use open fields, croplands with grain stubble, shorelines, and roadsides. </p></div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Food</h3><p>Snow Buntings eat grass and flowering-plant seeds as well as insects and spiders. They pick seeds and insects from the ground or leap up from the ground to grab a seed or other prey. </p></div>
                    <div><h3>Nesting</h3><p>Snow Buntings nest in rocky areas and boulder fields. The nest is typically in a hole in a rock, in a crevice between rocks, or in a crevice under a rock. Females put the nest at the back of the hole or crevice, such that it is rarely visible from the outside. In areas where nest sites are limited, instead of nesting among rocks, they nest in barrels, metal cans, boxes, buildings, and construction rubble. </p><br></div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior (det.)</h3><p>Snow Buntings are ground dwellers, walking or running to find seeds and insects. In the spring, they use hard-packed snow to clean their feathers, which results in a wearing of the feather tips to reveal the bright white feathers below. Males arrive on the breeding grounds 3â€“4 weeks before females to establish a territory. Males fight and chase all territory intruders. They approach intruders with a flight song display, rising into the air in song where they meet. The two birds often grapple with bills and feet as they tumble back to the ground. Males also use the flight song display to attract a female; males fly steeply up and glide back to the ground with their wings held in a "V." Following the flight display, males show prospecting females potential nest sites before they settle into a monogamous pair bond for the breeding season. Males may occasionally mate with another female. In the winter, restless flocks constantly flush along like blowing snow, with members leapfrogging over each other.</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Conservation</h3><p>Snow Buntings are common, but according to <a href="http://pif.birdconservancy.org/ACAD/Database.aspx">Partners in Flight</a> their populations declined 38% between 1970 and 2014. Partners in Flight estimates that the global breeding population is 29 million. The species rates an 8 out of 20 on Partners in Flight's <a href="http://www.stateofthebirds.org/2016/overview/methods/">Continental Concern Score</a>, which means it is not on the <a href="https://www.partnersinflight.org/watch-list-categories/">Watch List</a> and is a species of low conservation concern. Because Snow Buntings breed outside of areas monitored by the North American Breeding Bird survey, estimates of population size come from the Christmas Bird Count. Still these counts do not cover all of the wintering areas they use, so estimates of population size and trends may not be accurate. </p></div>
