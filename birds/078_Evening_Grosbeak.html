                    <div><h3>Size & Shape</h3><p>Evening Grosbeaks are large, heavyset finches with very thick, powerful, conical bills. They have a thick neck, full chest, and relatively short tail.</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Color Pattern</h3><p>Adult male Evening Grosbeaks are yellow and black birds with a prominent white patch in the wings. They have dark heads with a bright-yellow stripe over the eye. Females and immatures are mostly gray, with white-and-black wings and a greenish-yellow tinge to the neck and flanks. The bill is pale ivory on adult males and greenish-yellow on females. </p></div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior</h3><p><p>These are social birds that are often found in flocks, particularly in winter. They forage in treetops for insect larvae during the summer, buds in spring, and seeds, berries, and small fruits in winter.</p>
</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat</h3><p>They make very erratic movements south into the continental United States in some winters, when they can become common at backyard feeders. Away from backyards, they winter in forests and feed in both deciduous and coniferous trees, often at higher elevations. They breed in spruce-fir, pine-oak, pinyon-juniper, and aspen forests of northern North America and the mountains of the West.</p></div>

                <div>
                    <div><h3>Regional Differences</h3><p>There is little geographic variation in plumage, but Evening Grosbeaks do consist of at least three distinct populations, each with distinct call notes. </p></div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat (det)</h3>Evening Grosbeaks breed in mature and second-growth coniferous forests of northern North America and the Rocky Mountains, including spruce-fir, pine-oak, pinyon-juniper, and aspen forests. Less commonly, they nest in deciduous woodlands, parks, and orchards. They breed as far south as Mexico at 5,000–10,000 feet of elevation in pine and pine-oak woodlands. In winter Evening Grosbeaks live in coniferous forest and deciduous forest as well as in urban and suburban areas. When wintering in urban environments they are most abundant in small woodlots near bird feeders.</div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Food</h3>In summer, Evening Grosbeaks eat mostly invertebrates such as spruce budworm larvae, caterpillars, and aphids. They also eat a wide variety of seeds—including those of maple, box elder, ash, cherry, apple, tulip poplar, elm, pine, dock, bindweed, and goosefoot—and small fruits, such as ash fruits, cherries, crabapples, snowberries, hawthorn fruits, Russian olive fruits, and juniper berries. They may manipulate fleshy fruits such as cherries in their bills to remove the skin and flesh before cracking and swallowing the seed. Evening Grosbeaks typically feed at the tops of trees and shrubs, but you may see them come to the ground for fallen fruits and seeds or capture aerial insects in flight. They also eat the buds of maple, elm, willow, oak, aspen, and cherry, and drink maple sap by breaking off small maple twigs.</div>
                    <div><h3>Nesting</h3>Evening Grosbeaks nest high in trees or large shrubs, such as red spruce, black spruce, Norway spruce, white spruce, Engelmann spruce, white pine, Jeffrey pine, ponderosa pine, jack pine, balsam fir, Douglas-fir, white cedar, paper birch, beech, sugar maple, and willow. It’s unknown whether male or female Evening Grosbeaks choose the nest sites (although in the closely related Hawfinch of Eurasia, the male selects the site).<br></div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior (det.)</h3>Evening Grosbeaks are social birds that forage in flocks in winter and break off into small groups or pairs during the breeding season. Evening Grosbeaks show little aggression toward one another throughout the year. At winter feeders males may drive females and younger males away, but they do not defend feeding territories during the breeding season—probably because their food sources are often extremely abundant in local patches. During the nesting season they form monogamous pairs, after courting quietly without any elaborate song or display. Breeding birds tolerate other birds nearby but occasionally chase away species such as phoebes, Hairy Woodpeckers, American Robins, and Brown-headed Cowbirds. At feeders, Evening Grosbeaks are often accompanied by redpolls and Pine Siskins that glean the food scraps they leave behind.</div>
                    <div><h3>Conservation</h3>Evening Grosbeaks are numerous and widespread, but populations dropped steeply between 1966 and 2015, according to the North American Breeding Bird Survey—particularly in the East where numbers declined by 97% during that time. Partners in Flight estimates a global breeding population of 4.1 million, with 71% spending some part of the year in the U.S., 57% in Canada, and 5% living in Mexico. Evening Grosbeak rates a 13 out of 20 on the Continental Concern Score and is on the </div>
