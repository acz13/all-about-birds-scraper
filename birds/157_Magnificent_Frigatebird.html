Watching a Magnificent Frigatebird float in the air truly is, as the name implies, magnificent. These master aerialists are also pirates of the sky, stealing food from other birds in midair. Males have a bright red pouch on the throat, which they inflate like a balloon to attract females. Females unlike most other seabirds look different than males with their white chest. </p>

                    <div><h3>Size & Shape</h3><p><p>Magnificent Frigatebirds are large seabirds with long, angular wings. They have a deeply forked tail that is often held closed in a point. The bill is long and sturdy with a prominently hooked tip. </p>
</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Color Pattern</h3><p><p>Magnificent Frigatebirds are mostly black, but females and young birds have varying amounts of white on the head, chest, and belly. Females have a white chest and a dark head. Juveniles start with a white head and belly and gradually obtain darker heads. Young birds also have a pale tan streak on the upper wing. Breeding males are entirely black save for the bright red throat pouch, which is not always visible. </p>
</p></div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior</h3><p><p>Magnificent Frigatebirds soar over the ocean on outstretched wings with their head drawn into the shoulders. They rarely flap their wings, but when they do their wingbeats are slow and deep. Despite being a bird of the ocean, they don't dive after fish; instead they skim fish from the surface of the water or chase other birds, forcing them to give up their recent meal. </p>
</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat</h3><p><p>Magnificent Frigatebirds soar over tropical and subtropical oceans throughout the Americas. They forage in lagoons as well as far out to sea and nest in low-growing scrub vegetation on islands. </p>
</p></div>
                </div>
                
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Regional Differences</h3>None</div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat (det)</h3><p>Magnificent Frigatebirds range along coasts and islands in tropical and subtropical waters. They nest and roost in mangrove cays on coral reefs and in low trees and shrubs on islands. Magnificent Frigatebirds forage over warm oceans far out to sea, along the coast, and in shallow lagoons. </p></div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Food</h3><p>Magnificent Frigatebirds eat primarily flying fish, tuna, herring, and squid, which they grab from the surface of the water without getting wet. They also eat plankton, crabs, jellyfish, and other items on the surface of the water including discarded fish from fishing boats. Magnificent Frigatebirds forage for themselves, but they also chase and harass other seabirds and frigatebirds forcing them to regurgitate recently captured meals, swooping down to steal the meal before it hits the water. </p></div>
                    <div><h3>Nesting</h3><p>Magnificent Frigatebirds nests in dense colonies on top of low trees and shrubs on islands. Nests are packed into small areas and are often within striking distance of another nest. The female builds the nest on the display perch used by the male she chooses. </p><br></div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior (det.)</h3><p>Frigatebirds soar effortlessly over the ocean rarely flapping their long, pterodactyl-like wings and using the long tail to steer. Though they are frequently seen soaring, they are masters of pursuit. They chase other birds including frigatebirds, forcing them to regurgitate their recent meal, which they scoop up before it hits the water. Their gracefulness ends as soon as they head towards land, where they awkwardly perch in low shrubs and trees. Their strong toes help them hold onto branches, posts, and boat masts, but their small feet in combination with their short legs makes it nearly impossible for them to walk on land. On land, males often flutter the balloonlike throat sac (or "gular pouch") to cool off. Males and females also regulate their body temperature by holding up their wings up to sun themselves. To get airborne, they flap a few times and use the wind to help lift them into the air. Male Magnificent Frigatebirds gather in groups to court females. They perch in low trees and shrubs with their red throat sac inflated like a balloon and clatter their bills, waving their heads back and forth, and calling at females flying overhead. Females choose a mate and begin building a nest on the male's display perch. The pair stays together for up to 3 months, after which the male leaves and the female raises the chick alone for up to 1 year.</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Conservation</h3><p>Magnificent Frigatebirds are relatively common, but <a href="http://pif.birdconservancy.org/ACAD/Database.aspx">Partners in Flight</a> lists them as <a href="https://www.partnersinflight.org/watch-list-categories/">Yellow Watch List</a> species due to declining populations in the Americas. Magnificent Frigatebirds rate a 16 out of 20 on Partners in Flight <a href="http://www.stateofthebirds.org/2016/overview/methods/">Continental Concern Score</a>. The estimated global population is 59,000-71,000 breeding pairs. In areas where they breed, many populations are declining due to urban and resort development. Several islands in the Caribbean, including Marquesas Keys off of southern Florida, Aruba, and Seal Key in the Bahamas, no longer support breeding colonies following coastal development. Overfishing, predator introductions on nesting islands, and hurricanes may also reduce nesting success.</p></div>
