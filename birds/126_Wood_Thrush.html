This reclusive bird's cinnamon brown upperparts are good camouflage as it scrabbles for leaf-litter invertebrates deep in the forest, though it pops upright frequently to peer about, revealing a boldly spotted white breast. Though still numerous, its rapidly declining numbers may be due in part to cowbird nest parasitism at the edges of fragmenting habitat and to acid rain's depletion of its invertebrate prey.</p></div></div><div class="row"><ul class="LH-menu"><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Wood_Thrush/lifehistory#habitat"><span>Habitat</span><span>Forests</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Wood_Thrush/lifehistory#food"><span>Food</span><span>Insects</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Wood_Thrush/lifehistory#nesting"><span>Nesting</span><span>Tree</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Wood_Thrush/lifehistory#behavior"><span>Behavior</span><span>Ground Forager</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Wood_Thrush/lifehistory#conservation"><span>Conservation</span><span>Declining</span></a></li></ul></div></div>

                    <div><h3>Size & Shape</h3><p>The Wood Thrush's pot-bellied body, short tail, straight bill, big head, and upright posture give it the profile of a scaled-down American Robin. </p></div>
                    <div><h3>Color Pattern</h3><p>Wood Thrushes are warm reddish-brown above and white with bold black spots on their underparts. Juveniles show a somewhat muted version of the same pattern. All have a bold, white eyering. </p></div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior</h3><p>The reclusive Wood Thrush hops through leaf litter on the forest floor, probing for insects, bobbing upright between spurts of digging and leaf-turning. The male's clear, flute-like song echoes through the forest in spring and early summer, and both sexes make distinctive, machine-gun-like alarm notes. </p></div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat</h3><p>The Wood Thrush breeds in deciduous and mixed forests in the eastern U.S. where there are large trees, moderate understory, shade, and abundant leaf litter for foraging. They winter in lowland tropical forests in Central America.</p></div>

                    <div><h3>Regional Differences</h3><p>None.</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat (det)</h3>Wood Thrushes breed throughout mature deciduous and mixed forests in eastern North America, most commonly those with American beech, sweet gum, red maple, black gum, eastern hemlock, flowering dogwood, American hornbeam, oaks, or pines. They nest somewhat less successfully in fragmented forests and even suburban parks where there are enough large trees for a territory. Ideal habitat includes trees over 50 feet tall, a moderate understory of saplings and shrubs, an open floor with moist soil and decaying leaf litter, and water nearby. Favored understory species include southern arrowwood, smooth blackhaw, spicebush, coast pepperbush, rhododendron, and blueberry. In their winter range, they are most abundant in the interior of mature, shady, broad-leaved and palm tropical forests in lowlands. As in their temperate range, they will also inhabit forest edges and the denser understory of second-growth forests. </div>

                <div>
                    <div><h3>Food</h3>Wood Thrushes feed mostly on leaf-litter invertebrates and fruits from shrubs. Their summer diet is predominantly invertebrates, including adult beetles and flies, caterpillars, spiders, millipedes, woodlice, and ants. Insects, snails, and salamanders found in trees are occasional prey. Fruits like spicebush, fox grape, blueberry, holly, elderberry, jack-in-the-pulpit, Virginia creeper, pokeweed, dogwood, black cherry, and black gum make up most of the rest of their diet. Parents feed chicks soft invertebrates and pre-softened fruits. In late summer and fall, after breeding season, Wood Thrushes shift their diet toward fruits (particularly fatty fruits) in preparation for the demands of migration. Fruits remain important on migration and in winter, though Wood Thrushes remain omnivorous, eating a wide variety of insects as well. </div>
                    <div><h3>Nesting</h3>The nest is usually in the lower branches of a sapling or shrub, where a fork provides good support and twigs or foliage provide shade and cover. The male may call attention to a spot by calling or by placing nest materials nearby, but the final decision is the female's. <br></div>

                    <div><h3>Conservation</h3>Wood Thrush are still common throughout the deciduous forests of eastern North America, but populations declined by almost 2 percent per year between 1966 and 2015 resulting in a cumulative decline of 62% percent, according to the North American Breeding Bird Survey. Partners in Flight estimates a global breeding population of 11 million with 94% spending part of the year in the U.S., 39% in Mexico, and 6% breeding in Canada. Wood Thrush is a U.S.-Canada Stewardship species, and rates a 14 out of 20 on the Continental Concern Score. It is listed as a Tri-National Concern species and is on the </div>
