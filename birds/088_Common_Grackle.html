They're taller and longer tailed than a typical blackbird, with a longer, more tapered bill and glossy-iridescent bodies. Grackles walk around lawns and fields on their long legs or gather in noisy groups high in trees, typically evergreens. They eat many crops (notably corn) and nearly anything else as well, including garbage. In flight their long tails trail behind them, sometimes folded down the middle into a shallow V shape.</p></div></div><div class="row"><ul class="LH-menu"><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Common_Grackle/lifehistory#habitat"><span>Habitat</span><span>Open Woodlands</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Common_Grackle/lifehistory#food"><span>Food</span><span>Omnivore</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Common_Grackle/lifehistory#nesting"><span>Nesting</span><span>Tree</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Common_Grackle/lifehistory#behavior"><span>Behavior</span><span>Ground Forager</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Common_Grackle/lifehistory#conservation"><span>Conservation</span><span>Common Bird in Steep Decline</span></a></li></ul></div></div>

                    <div><h3>Size & Shape</h3><p>Common Grackles are large, lanky blackbirds with long legs and long tails. The head is flat and the bill is longer than in most blackbirds, with the hint of a downward curve. In flight, the wings appear short in comparison to the tail. Males are slightly larger than females.</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Color Pattern</h3><p>Common Grackles appear black from a distance, but up close their glossy purple heads contrast with bronzy-iridescent bodies. A bright golden eye gives grackles an intent expression. Females are slightly less glossy than males. Young birds are dark brown with a dark eye.</p></div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior</h3><p>You’ll often find Common Grackles in large flocks, flying or foraging on lawns and in agricultural fields. They strut on their long legs, pecking for food rather than scratching. At feeders Common Grackles dominate smaller birds. When resting they sit atop trees or on telephone lines, keeping up a raucous chattering. Flight is direct, with stiff wingbeats.</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat</h3><p>Common Grackles thrive around agricultural fields, feedlots, city parks, and suburban lawns. They’re also common in open habitats including woodland, forest edges, meadows, and marshes.</p></div>
                </div>
                
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Regional Differences</h3><p>The “bronzed grackle” race of the Common Grackle, breeding roughly west of the Appalachians and in New England, has the characteristic bronzy back. Birds of the Southeast, from North Carolina to Louisiana, often called the “Florida grackle,” are darker green on the back rather than bronzy, and they're purple on the belly. An intermediate race along the Eastern seaboard is sometimes called the purple grackle.</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat (det)</h3>Common Grackles do well in human landscapes, using scattered trees for nesting and open ground for foraging. Typical natural habitats include open woodland, forest edge, grassland, meadows, swamps, marshes, and palmetto hammocks. They are also very common near agricultural fields and feedlots, suburbs, city parks, cemeteries, pine plantations, and hedgerows. Unbroken tracts of forest are the only places where you are unlikely to find Common Grackles.</div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Food</h3>Common Grackles eat mostly seeds, particularly agricultural grains such as corn and rice. Other seeds include sunflower seeds, acorns, tree seeds such as sweetgum, wild and cultivated fruits, and garbage. In summer, one-quarter or more of a grackle’s diet may be animals, including beetles, grasshoppers, caterpillars, spiders, crustaceans, mollusks, fish, frogs, salamanders, mice, and other birds.</div>
                    <div><h3>Nesting</h3>The female chooses the nest site, with the male sometimes following along as she surveys. After beginning to build, females often seem to change their minds and select another site. Typically the nest is high in a coniferous tree between two vertical limbs or on a horizontal branch (although they’ve been recorded as low as 8 inches off the ground and in deciduous vegetation, cattails and other sites). Nests are often built near water. Rarely, Common Grackles nest in unusual places such as birdhouses, woodpecker holes, cliff crevices, barns, and still-occupied nests of Osprey and Great Blue Herons.<br></div>

                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior (det.)</h3>Common Grackles are large, noisy, and gregarious birds that often flock with other blackbirds, cowbirds, and starlings, especially in winter. At feeders they tower over other birds and push them aside to get at food. Grackles typically forage on the ground and roost high in trees or on power lines. Common Grackles sometimes nest in loose colonies of up to 200 pairs, showing little territoriality except in the immediate area of the nest. In spring when birds are pairing, you may see three kinds of playful chases: first, a group of males will fly after a slow-flying female; second, a single male will chase a female at high speed; and third, a male and female will fly slowly and conspicuously alongside each other. In normal flight, grackles fly in a direct path on stiff wingbeats.</div>
                    <div><h3>Conservation</h3>Common Grackles are abundant and widespread, though populations declined by almost 2% per year between 1966 and 2014, resulting in a cumulative decline of 58%, according to the North American Breeding Bird Survey. Partners in Flight estimates a global breeding population of 61 million, with 100% spending part of the year in the U.S., and 10% breeding in Canada. They rate an 8 out of 20 on the Continental Concern Score and the </div>
