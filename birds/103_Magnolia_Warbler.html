The female lacks the male's bold accoutrements, instead wearing an elegant white eyering on her gray head, 2 thin white wingbars, and yellow underparts with moderate streaking. These boreal warblers breed in dense stands of conifers and stop off in all types of forests during migration, where they forage at the tips of branches.</p>

</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Color Pattern</h3><p><p>Adult males have a black mask and distinctive black streaking that radiates from a black neck band creating a necklaced look. Males are gray and black above with a wide white wing patch, and a yellow throat and belly. Females and immatures have a gray head, a white eyering, a faint gray band across the neck, and 2 narrow white wingbars. From below on both sexes note the unique tail pattern; white at the base and black at the tip. </p>

                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior</h3><p><p>Often forages low in the understory, picking insects from the undersides of leaves. During migration also forages higher in the canopy with other warblers. Sometimes flashes its tail, exposing white spots, similar to the behavior of an American Redstart. </p>
</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat</h3><p><p>Breeds in small conifers, especially young spruces, in purely coniferous stands or mixed forests. During migration found in dense vegetation often at forest edges. </p>

                    <div><h3>Habitat (det)</h3><p>Magnolia Warblers breed in dense stands of young conifer trees, especially spruce in the north and hemlock in the south. During migration they forage in dense areas along forest edges, woodlots, and parks. On the wintering grounds, they occur from sea level to 5,000 feet in a variety of areas including cacao plantations, orchards, forests, and thickets. </p></div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Food</h3><p>Magnolia Warblers primarily eat caterpillars, especially spruce budworm when it is abundant. They also eat insects and spiders and occasionally take fruit in the fall. They tend to forage on the outer edges of branches, searching the undersides of needles and leaves for prey. </p></div>
                    <div><h3>Nesting</h3><p>Magnolia Warblers nest in dense conifers such as spruce, balsam fir, and hemlock. The nest is typically on a horizontal branch close to the trunk of the tree and is less than 10 feet above the ground. </p><br></div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior (det.)</h3><p>Magnolia Warblers hop from branch to branch in dense stands of young conifer trees. They pick insects primarily from the undersides of conifer needles and foliage. Males sing most intensely at dawn and dusk and even sing while foraging. Males court females with song and show off the white spots on their tail, similar to the behavior of an American Redstart. To warn a territory intruder, males also spread their tail, flashing their white tail spots. Males and females maintain a shared territory on the breeding grounds, but separate territories on the wintering grounds. During migration they frequently join foraging flocks of chickadees, and they join mixed-species flocks on the wintering grounds. </p></div>
                    <div><h3>Conservation</h3><p>Magnolia Warblers are common and their populations increased by almost 1% per year from 1966 to 2015, according to the <a href="https://www.mbr-pwrc.usgs.gov/bbs/specl15.html">North American Breeding Bird Survey</a>. <a href="http://pif.birdconservancy.org/ACAD/Database.aspx">Partners in Flight</a> estimates the estimated global breeding population at 39 million. The species rates a 7 out of 20 on the <a href="http://www.stateofthebirds.org/2016/overview/methods/">Continental Concern Score</a>, which means it is not on the<a href="https://www.partnersinflight.org/watch-list-categories/"> Partners in Flight Watch List</a> and is a species of low conservation concern. </p></div>
