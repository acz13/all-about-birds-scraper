It’s quite a bit harder to spot a Northern Bobwhite, as the bird’s elegantly dappled plumage offers excellent camouflage. They forage in groups, scurrying between cover or bursting into flight if alarmed. Bobwhites have been in sharp decline throughout the past half-century, likely owing to habitat loss and changes in agriculture, and they are an increasingly high priority for conservation.</p></div></div><div class="row"><ul class="LH-menu"><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Northern_Bobwhite/lifehistory#habitat"><span>Habitat</span><span>Grasslands</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Northern_Bobwhite/lifehistory#food"><span>Food</span><span>Plants</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Northern_Bobwhite/lifehistory#nesting"><span>Nesting</span><span>Ground</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Northern_Bobwhite/lifehistory#behavior"><span>Behavior</span><span>Ground Forager</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Northern_Bobwhite/lifehistory#conservation"><span>Conservation</span><span>Common Bird in Steep Decline</span></a></li></ul></div></div>

                <div>
                    <div><h3>Size & Shape</h3><p>Bobwhite are small quail with rounded bodies, small heads, rounded wings, and short tails.</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Color Pattern</h3><p>They are intricately patterned in brown, rufous, buff, and black. Males have a bold black-and-white head pattern. Females have a buffy throat and eyebrow.</p></div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior</h3><p>Northern Bobwhites travel in coveys and run across the ground from the shelter of one shrubby patch to another. When they are flushed, they explode into flight with quick wingbeats and then duck into the nearest cover. </p></div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat</h3><p>Northern Bobwhites live in open pine forests, overgrown fields, shrubby areas, and grasslands. They respond well to areas managed with prescribed fire, which helps to maintain an open, grassy ground layer. </p></div>
                </div>
                
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Regional Differences</h3><p>Male Northern Bobwhite vary considerably, but females look similar across their range. Males in the Southeast have more extensive black on the throat and breast than birds elsewhere. Great Plains and Texas birds are grayer on the back. Eastern birds have rufous across the breast. An isolated and endangered Southwestern population, called the “Masked” Bobwhite, is nearly all black on the head and rufous on the breast. Females are not as variable and look very similar across their range. There are also extremely rare rufous adults that are almost entirely reddish brown.</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat (det)</h3>Northern Bobwhites are year-round residents in open habitats of southeastern North America. They live in agricultural fields, grasslands, open pine or pine-hardwood forests, and grass-brush rangelands as far north as Massachusetts and southern Ontario, and as far west as southeastern Wyoming and eastern New Mexico. They seem to avoid mature woodlands, inhabiting instead the early stages of regrowth after a fire, farming, logging, or other disturbance. They are most numerous in patchwork areas of fields, forests, and croplands; in coastal Texas rangelands; and in southern pine forests that are intensively managed for bobwhite hunting. During snowfalls in the northern part of their range, bobwhites depend on woody cover to prevent snow from reaching the ground and blocking their foraging habitat.</div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Food</h3>Bobwhites eat mostly seeds and leaves, supplemented with varying amounts of insects during the breeding season. Chicks are fed mostly insects until they are 6–8 weeks old. Arthropods can make up 5 percent of the male’s diet and 20 percent of the female’s diet during the breeding season. Bobwhites forage as a group, scratching and pecking through leaf litter or foraging on low plants. When snow falls they seek out patches of bare ground under brushy areas. Their staple food of seeds comes from agricultural crops, weeds, forest plants, and rangeland vegetation. During fall and winter they eat many legume seeds, ragweed seeds, pine seeds, and acorns. In the spring they eat more leafy green parts of plants, and in the summer their diet includes grass seeds, some fruits, and arthropods—such as bugs, flies, bees, wasps, beetles, and spiders.</div>
                    <div><h3>Nesting</h3>The male and the female jointly choose a nest site on the ground or in low vegetation, usually within 65 feet of an opening such as a field or road.<br></div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior (det.)</h3>Northern Bobwhites are highly social, usually found in groups, or coveys, of 3–20 individuals. They feed in early morning and late afternoon. At night, coveys usually roost on the ground (or occasionally in vegetation) in a close-packed, outward-facing circle with their tails pointing toward the center, probably to conserve heat and stay on the alert. They coexist peacefully for most of the year, but in the breeding season male bobwhites fight to attract mates. Both males and females perform courtship displays. Originally thought to be monogamous, they actually have several breeding strategies: males can raise broods with multiple females; and females can raise broods with multiple males (although males often abandon such broods). Bobwhites sometimes intermingle their eggs with those of Ring-necked Pheasants and free-range domestic chickens. Hawks, owls, raccoons, opossums, skunks, foxes, and snakes prey on adult bobwhites and their young. Adults flutter and drag their wings to distract predators from their chicks.</div>
                    <div><h3>Conservation</h3>Northern Bobwhites were once a common species in eastern North America, but experienced widespread, sharp declines between 1966 to 2014, up to 4% per year, resulting in a cumulative decline of 85%, according to the North American Breeding Bird Survey. Partners in Flight estimates a global breeding population of 5.8 million with 84% living in the U.S., and 11% in Mexico. They rate an 11 out of 20 on the Partners in Flight Continental Concern Score.
