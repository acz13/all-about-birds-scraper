It’s North America's largest sparrow and the only songbird that breeds in Canada and nowhere else in the world. In winter it settles in the south-central Great Plains, where it is a backyard favorite. Unfortunately, Harris's Sparrow populations are declining; its restricted range make it vulnerable to habitat loss on the wintering and breeding grounds. </p></div></div><div class="row"><ul class="LH-menu"><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Harriss_Sparrow/lifehistory#habitat"><span>Habitat</span><span>Forests</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Harriss_Sparrow/lifehistory#food"><span>Food</span><span>Seeds</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Harriss_Sparrow/lifehistory#nesting"><span>Nesting</span><span>Ground</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Harriss_Sparrow/lifehistory#behavior"><span>Behavior</span><span>Ground Forager</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Harriss_Sparrow/lifehistory#conservation"><span>Conservation</span><span>Declining</span></a></li></ul></div></div>

                    <div><h3>Size & Shape</h3><p>Harris's Sparrows are large and chunky sparrows. Their big barrel-shaped chest makes their round head look a little small for their body. They have a long tail and a medium-sized conical bill. </p></div>
                    <div><h3>Color Pattern</h3><p>Harris's Sparrows are streaky brown and black overall with a black bib, face, and crown. As they get older, the black areas around the face change from patchy black in juveniles to fully black in adults. Breeding adults have a gray cheek and nape while these areas are brown in nonbreeding birds. Juveniles and adults in all seasons have a pink bill, a white belly, and black streaks down the back. </p></div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior</h3><p>Harris's Sparrows spend a lot of time foraging on the ground, often venturing boldly out into the open to look for food. If disturbed while feeding they often fly up into a tree or shrub instead of running along the ground for cover. </p></div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat</h3><p>Harris's Sparrows breed exclusively in northern Canada in areas of open tundra mixed with white pine, black spruce, larch, alder, and willow. In winter they use hedgerows, agricultural fields, shrubby pastures, backyards, and shrubby areas near streams of the southern Great Plains. </p></div>

                    <div><h3>Regional Differences</h3>None</div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat (det)</h3>Harris's Sparrows breed in semiforested tundra areas in northern Canada. Here the open tundra is broken up by patches of white pine, black spruce, larch, alder, and willow mixed with dwarf shrubs, sedges, and dense patches of lichens. In the winter, they use hedgerows, agricultural fields, shrubby pastures, backyards, and shrubby areas near streams. They generally do not use dense woods or dry shortgrass prairies. </div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Food</h3>Seeds, fruits, plant material, and insects are all part of the Harris's Sparrow diet. During the nonbreeding season they eat mainly seeds from ragweed, knotweed, and goosefoot, but they also visit bird feeders. Early in the breeding season when insects are less abundant they eat a lot of crowberries (a relative of the blueberry), bearberries, and other berries that are still on shrubs from the previous growing season. Once the tundra warms up they eat flies, beetles, butterflies, and other insects. They also eat plant buds, sedges, grasses, and young spruce needles. </div>
                    <div><h3>Nesting</h3>The female builds a nest on the ground usually below a short alder, spruce, dwarf birch, or dwarf Labrador tea. She tends to build the nest on the side of the shrub that is out of the prevailing winds.<br></div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior (det.)</h3>Like other sparrows, Harris's Sparrows hop along the ground scratching at the surface or jump to pick food off a low branch. Although they spend a lot of time foraging on the ground, they hop into small shrubs and trees to rest or to sing. If they feel threatened they also tend to fly into a tree or shrub rather than run along the ground to seek cover. Males and females arrive on the breeding grounds at about the same time and start forming pairs within a week. Males sing from exposed perches in trees and shrubs to establish territory boundaries. Males and females form monogamous bonds during the breeding season, but they find new mates each year. Males tend to return to the same territory year after year especially if they succeeded in raising young. Though pairs are solitary during the breeding season, they forage with other Harris's Sparrows as well as other sparrow species on the wintering grounds. Foraging flocks may look friendly, but these flocks have a pecking order; older individuals with darker throat patches dominate the younger, lighter colored birds within the flock and may chase or push them out of the way. </div>
                    <div><h3>Conservation</h3>Harris’s Sparrows breed in remote areas of northern Canada, outside the area covered by the North American Breeding Bird Survey. The best long-term data on their overall population comes from the Christmas Bird Count, conducted on their wintering grounds in the United States. This survey suggests that the species declined by 1.8% per year between 1965 and 2003, resulting in a cumulative decline of 49% during that time. Additional surveys conducted since then indicate a cumulative decline of 63% from 1970–2014. Partners in Flight estimates the global breeding population at 2 million, all of which breed in northern Canada and winter in the United States. Harris's Sparrow is on the </div>
