This secretive brown-and-gray marsh bird is a Sora, but drab it is not. When it finally pokes its head out of the reeds its bright yellow bill might have you thinking about Halloween candy corns. The Sora walks slowly through shallow wetlands a bit like a chicken that has had too much coffee, nervously flicking its tail and exposing the white feathers below. </p>

                    <div><h3>Size & Shape</h3><p><p>Soras are small, chubby, chickenlike birds with long toes. They have a stubby bill unlike other rails in the United States and Canada, which have longer bills. They frequently hold their short tail cocked up.</p>
</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Color Pattern</h3><p><p>Soras are mottled gray and brown with white-edged feathers, but the feature that stands out the most is their yellow candy-corn bill. Other notable features include a black mask and throat patch, vertical white lines on the sides, and a white patch under the tail. Females tend to be less brightly colored than males and have less black on the face and throat. Juveniles also lack the black mask.</p>
</p></div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior</h3><p><p>Soras walk through shallow wetlands pushing their head forward with every step while nervously flicking the tail upward, exposing the white undertail feathers. They tend to forage in dense vegetation, but also venture into open areas from time to time. Their long toes help them walk on top of floating mats of vegetation. </p>
</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat</h3><p><p>Soras make their homes in freshwater wetlands with emergent vegetation such as cattails, sedges, and rushes. During migration and winter, they also use brackish marshes, flooded fields, and wet pastures. </p>
</p></div>
                </div>
                
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Regional Differences</h3>None</div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat (det)</h3><p>Soras spend most of the year in freshwater and brackish wetlands with cattail, sedges, and rushes. During migration and winter, they also use wet pastures, ditches, impoundments, and flooded fields. </p></div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Food</h3><p>Soras primarily eat seeds from wetland plants, but also eat aquatic invertebrates. They rake floating vegetation with their long toes in search of sedge, bulrush, grass, rice, and smartweed seeds. They also peck at the water's surface for seeds and aquatic insects such as snails, dragonflies, flies, and beetles. </p></div>
                    <div><h3>Nesting</h3><p>Soras nest at the edges of shallow wetlands (less than about 8 inches deep) in dense patches of cattails and sedges. They build a nest either on top of mounds of vegetation or attached to plant stems above the surface of the water. </p><br></div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior (det.)</h3><p>Soras flick their tail as they walk slowly along the muddy edges of wetlands pecking at the surface for seeds, but they can also run with lightning speed and disappear from view in a flash. They often stay hidden in dense vegetation, but forage in the open and swim across open water on occasion. Soras tend toward secrecy, but they aggressively defend their territories from other Soras. Their threat display includes neck stretching, bowing, and tail and wing spreading. If displaying fails to warn off an intruder, the territory owner gives chase. Males and females form monogamous bonds during the breeding season. Pairs court each other with a 15â€“30-minute stare-down followed by preening. </p></div>
                    <div><h3>Conservation</h3><p>Soras are common and the most abundant rail species in North America. Their population was stable between 1966 and 2015, according to the <a href="http://www.mbr-pwrc.usgs.gov/bbs/specl15.html">North American Breeding Bird Survey</a>. <a href="http://pif.birdconservancy.org/ACAD/Database.aspx">Partners in Flight</a> rates Sora a 9 out of 20 on the <a href="http://www.stateofthebirds.org/2016/overview/methods/">Continental Concern Score</a>, which means it is not on the <a href="https://www.partnersinflight.org/watch-list-categories/">Partners in Flight Watch List</a>. Although Sora populations are stable, they rely on wetland habitat that is dwindling due to urban and agricultural development. Soras migrate at night and frequently collide with lighted towers during migration, which could potentially affect the population. Sora hunting is legal in 31 states and in Manitoba and Ontario, Canada, but the popularity of hunting Sora has declined in recent years and it is unclear if hunting has any significant impacts.</p></div>
