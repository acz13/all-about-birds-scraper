Look for these furtive, yellow-and-olive warblers skulking through tangled vegetation, often at the edges of marshes and wetlands. Females lack the mask and are much browner, though they usually show a hint of warm yellow at the throat. Yellowthroats are vocal birds, and both their <em>witchety-witchety-witchety</em> songs and distinctive call notes help reveal the presence of this, one of our most numerous warblers. </p></div></div><div class="row"><ul class="LH-menu"><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Common_Yellowthroat/lifehistory#habitat"><span>Habitat</span><span>Scrub</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Common_Yellowthroat/lifehistory#food"><span>Food</span><span>Insects</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Common_Yellowthroat/lifehistory#nesting"><span>Nesting</span><span>Shrub</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Common_Yellowthroat/lifehistory#behavior"><span>Behavior</span><span>Foliage Gleaner</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Common_Yellowthroat/lifehistory#conservation"><span>Conservation</span><span>Low Concern</span></a></li></ul></div></div>

                    <div><h3>Size & Shape</h3><p>Common Yellowthroats are small songbirds with chunky, rounded heads and medium-length, slightly rounded tails.</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Color Pattern</h3><p>Adult males are bright yellow below, with a sharp black face mask and olive upperparts. A thin whitish line sets off the black mask from the head and neck. Immature males show traces of the full mask of adult males. Females are a plain olive brown, usually with yellow brightening the throat and under the tail. They lack the black mask. </p></div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior</h3><p>Common Yellowthroats spend much of their time skulking low to the ground in dense thickets and fields, searching for small insects and spiders. Males sing a very distinctive, rolling <em>wichety-wichety-wichety</em> song, and both sexes give a full-sounding <em>chuck</em> note that is easy to learn. During migration, this is often the most common warbler found in fields and edges. It sometimes joins other warbler species in mixed foraging flocks.</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat</h3><p>Yellowthroats live in open areas with thick, low vegetation, ranging from marsh to grassland to open pine forest. During migration, they use an even broader suite of habitats including backyards and forest.</p></div>

                    <div><h3>Regional Differences</h3>None</div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat (det)</h3>Common Yellowthroats live in thick, tangled vegetation in a wide range of habitats—from wetlands to prairies to pine forests—across North America. Their breeding range stretches across most of the United States, the Canadian provinces, and western Mexico. Yellowthroats are most common in wet areas, which tend to have dense vegetation low to the ground, ideal for skulking and building hidden nests. But they are also found in dry upland pine forests, palmetto thickets, drainage ditches, hedgerows, orchards, fields, burned-over oak forests, shrub-covered hillsides, river edges, and disturbed sites. They winter in similar habitats with dense vegetation in the southern United States, Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean.</div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Food</h3>Common Yellowthroats forage on or near the ground, eating insects and spiders from leaves, bark, branches, flowers, or fruit in low vegetation. Their diet includes bugs, flies, beetles, ants, termites, bees, wasps, grasshoppers, dragonflies, damselflies, moths, butterflies, caterpillars, and other larvae. Though they mostly glean their food while perched, they may sally out from a perch to catch prey. Like many birds, Common Yellowthroats also eat grit, which possibly helps them digest food or adds minerals to their diet.</div>
                    <div><h3>Nesting</h3>The female selects a nest site, which is usually on or near the ground and supported by sedges, grasses, reeds, cattails, briars, skunk cabbage, or other low plants. Nests in marshy areas are usually higher off the ground, where they are safer from flooding. On rare occasions the female may build in vegetation growing out of the water.<br></div>

                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior (det.)</h3>Males arrive first on breeding grounds in the spring and begin defending territories, fighting more intensely when the females arrive. The black mask is an important signal in male fighting: when researchers added a black paper mask to a stuffed female, males started attacking the stuffed bird, as if it were a male rival. Eventually, a male pairs up with a female and begins following her closely until she signals that she’s ready to mate, by fluttering her wings and giving a fast series of chips. This display also attracts other males, which may mate with the female behind her mate’s back. The females themselves may defend their territories against other females. Once the nestlings hatch and the parents are busy feeding the young brood, they relax their territorial defense. Nest predators include snakes, mice, chipmunks, raccoons, skunks, and possums, while adult yellowthroats are sometimes prey for Loggerhead Shrikes, Northern Harriers, Merlins, and American Kestrels. On wintering grounds, Common Yellowthroats may forage in mixed-species flocks but are usually solitary.</div>
                    <div><h3>Conservation</h3>Common Yellowthroats are numerous but they declining by almost 1% per year between 1966 and 2014, resulting in a cumulative decline of about 38%, according to the North American Breeding Bird Survey. Partners in Flight estimates the global breeding population at 87 million with 54% spending some part of the year in the U.S., 58% in Mexico, and 41% breeding in Canada. They rate a 9 out of 20 on the Continental Concern Score and are not on the </div>
