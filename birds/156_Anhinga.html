What may sound like the Loch Ness monster is actually an Anhinga, swimming underwater and stabbing fish with its daggerlike bill. After every dip, it strikes a regal pose on the edges of shallow lakes and ponds, with its silvery wings outstretched and head held high to dry its waterlogged feathers. Once dry, it takes to the sky, soaring high on thermals stretched out like a cross.</p>

                <div>
                    <div><h3>Size & Shape</h3><p><p>Anhingas are large and slender waterbirds with long fanlike tails that resemble a turkey's tail. They have a long S-shaped neck and a daggerlike bill. In flight, Anhingas look like a flying cross; the wings are held out flat and the neck and tail stick straight out. They have slim bodies and look rather flattened in flight. </p>
</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Color Pattern</h3><p><p>Adult male Anhingas are black with silvery to white streaks on the back and wings. Females and immatures have a pale tan head, neck, and breast. The bill, legs, and feet are yellowish orange. </p>
</p></div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior</h3><p><p>Anhingas swim with their bodies partly or mostly submerged and their long, snakelike neck held partially out of the water. After a swim they perch on branches or logs to dry out, holding their wings out and spreading their tails. They frequently soar high in the sky, riding on thermals much like raptors and vultures. </p>
</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat</h3><p><p>Year-round, Anhingas inhabit shallow freshwater lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams with branches or logs near the water for drying and sunning themselves. They also use brackish bays and lagoons along the coast, but they generally don't use areas with extensive open water.</p>
</p></div>
                </div>
                
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Regional Differences</h3>None</div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat (det)</h3><p>The Anhinga lives in shallow, slow-moving, sheltered waters and uses nearby perches and banks for drying and sunning. It's rarely found out of freshwater except during severe droughts. Generally not found in extensive areas of open water, though it may nest on edges of open bays and lakes. Breeds in association with other waterbirds such as herons, egrets, ibises, storks, and cormorants. The Anhinga may also breed in saltwater colonies and feed in freshwater.</p></div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Food</h3><p>The Anhinga's diet consists of many small- to medium-sized wetland fishes, with very small amounts of crustaceans and invertebrates. It swims slowly underwater, stalking fish around submerged vegetation. Anhingas typically spear fish through their sides with a rapid thrust of their partially opened bill. They usually stab with both mandibles, but may use the upper mandible only on small fish. The side-spearing habit of the Anhinga suggests that the usual hunting method is by stalking rather than pursuit.</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Nesting</h3><p>The Anhinga typically nests in loose groups of several to hundreds of pairs, and sometimes with other colonial waterbirds. The nest is usually in a tree near to water or overhanging it.</p><br></div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior (det.)</h3><p>The Anhinga swims lower in the water than many other birds due to its reduced buoyancy-a result of wetted plumage and dense bones. When at the surface, it tends to swim low in the water, often with only the neck and head above the water, and sometimes with only the bill exposed. The Anhinga is also an adept soarer. While soaring, it holds its wings flat and straight, its neck outstretched or held with a slight kink; its long, straight tail is conspicuous. Anhingas often use thermals for soaring, and may achieve altitudes of several thousand feet.</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Conservation</h3><p>Anhingas are uncommon throughout their range and they reside in areas that can be difficult to reach, thus obtaining a relatively accurate estimate of their population is difficult. The best available estimate of their population comes from the North American Breeding Bird Survey and Partners in Flight. According to the <a href="https://www.mbr-pwrc.usgs.gov/bbs/specl15.html">North American Breeding Bird Survey</a> populations increased by nearly 1.5% between 1966 and 2015. <a href="http://pif.birdconservancy.org/ACAD/Database.aspx">Partners in Flight</a> estimates the global breeding population at 83,000 individuals. Based on the population size, distribution, threats, and population trends, the species rates a 9 out of 20 on the <a href="http://www.stateofthebirds.org/2016/overview/methods/">Continental Concern Score</a>. It is not on the <a href="https://www.partnersinflight.org/watch-list-categories/">Partners in Flight Watch List</a> and is a species of low conservation concern. Potential threats to Anhingas include wetland which may reduce available habitat for Anhinga. Discarded fishing lines also pose a threat because the birds can easily get tangled up in them.</p></div>
