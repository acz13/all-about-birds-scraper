It’s a common breeder from northern boreal forests to hardwoods of the southeastern U.S., and even cypress swamps. Many bird watchers know its distinctive and persistent song, sometimes transcribed as <em>trees trees I love trees, </em>that’s easy to remember. Black-throated Green Warblers are the easternmost representative of a quartet of closely related warblers including Townsend’s, Hermit, and Golden-cheeked.</p>

                <div>
                    <div><h3>Size & Shape</h3><p><p>The Black-throated Green Warbler is a medium-sized warbler similar in size and shape to many others in the <em>Setophaga </em>genus. Plump and seemingly large-headed, with a thick, straight bill and shortish tail. </p>
</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Color Pattern</h3><p><p>These are olive-green birds, white below, with yellow faces and black on the front. Adult males are stunning, with a bright yellow face and extensive black on the throat turning to black streaks on the flanks. Two bright white wingbars. Females and young birds are patterned like males, but duller and lacking the extensive black on the throat. </p>
</p></div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior</h3><p><p>Active and agile, Black-throated Green Warblers primarily forage for small insects hiding in the bases of the leaves of tall trees. Breeding males sing on exposed perches where their bright head is conspicuous. In fall migration and winter, they often join mixed-species flocks with resident birds. </p>
</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat</h3><p><p>Black-throated Green Warblers use coniferous and mixed forests in the north, deciduous forests in the south, and coastal cypress swamps in the case of the unique “Wayne’s” subspecies. Migrating birds will frequent any woody habitat, even coming down from the canopy to forage on fruiting shrubs. Wintering birds are typically found in the canopies of tall mature forests in Middle America, but sometimes occur in secondary growth as well.</p>
</p></div>
                </div>
                
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Regional Differences</h3><p><p>The southeastern “Wayne’s” subspecies, which occurs in coastal cypress swamps of Virginia and the Carolinas, is slightly smaller than other populations. </p>
</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat (det)</h3><p>The Black-throated Green Warbler occurs in a wide variety of forest habitats. They nest in conifer forests in the northwest of their range, mixed hardwoods forests in the southern Appalachians, and cypress swamps on the mid-Atlantic coast. Wintering birds are most common in the canopies of tall forests.</p></div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Food</h3><p>They eat almost exclusively insects during the breeding season, especially caterpillars, which they glean from small branches on both coniferous and deciduous trees. They also take berries in migration and feed on the buds of cecropia trees while wintering in the tropics. </p></div>
                    <div><h3>Nesting</h3><p>The female chooses the nest site, which is usually 3-10 feet off the ground (sometimes much higher) in a small tree or sapling, and is located close to the trunk. The "Wayne's" subspecies often nests higher up and farther from the trunk, in a cypress, oak, or magnolia.</p><br></div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior (det.)</h3><p>Black-throated Green Warblers hop through arboreal vegetation, flying between trees but seldom above trees. The males are aggressive when on territory, attacking and chasing rivals. This is sometimes followed by the victor undertaking a shallow, mothlike flight. Males singing on territory often choose an exposed perch from which their yellow head will be conspicuous. Pairs are seasonally monogamous, remaining together until shortly after the young leave the nest. In fall migration this species often forms mixed-species flocks with other species of southbound warblers and resident songbirds. Black-throated Green Warblers also join mixed flocks of tropical species in winter. </p></div>
                    <div><h3>Conservation</h3><p>Black-throated Green Warblers are common and their populations increased by an estimated 41% between 1970 and 2014, according to <a href="http://pif.birdconservancy.org/ACAD/Database.aspx">Partners in Flight</a>. The group estimates a global population of 8.7 million and assigns the species a <a href="http://www.stateofthebirds.org/2016/overview/methods/">Continental Concern Score</a> of 9 out of 20. It is not on the <a href="https://www.partnersinflight.org/watch-list-categories/">Watch List</a>, meaning it is a species of low conservation concern. The largest conservation issue for Black-throated Green Warblers is habitat degradation and loss. Despite its expansive breeding range, Black-throated Green Warblers are more commonly found in forest interiors than edges, so they’re susceptible to fragmentation. Invasive insects like woody adelgids have also caused the widespread death of conifers in some parts of the species’ range, leading to the disappearance of local populations in affected areas. Deforestation on the tropical wintering grounds removes some wintering habitat, although Black-throated Green Warblers will use native canopy trees on shade-grown coffee plantations or logged areas provided that some emergent vegetation remains.</p></div>
