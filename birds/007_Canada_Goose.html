                    <div><h3>Size & Shape</h3><p>Canada Geese are big waterbirds with a long neck, large body, large webbed feet, and wide, flat bill. </p></div>
                    <div><h3>Color Pattern</h3><p>Canada Geese have a black head with white cheeks and chinstrap, black neck, tan breast, and brown back.</p></div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior</h3><p>Canada Geese feed by dabbling in the water or grazing in fields and large lawns. They are often seen in flight moving in pairs or flocks; flocks often assume a V formation. </p></div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat</h3><p>Just about anywhere near lakes, rivers, ponds, or other small or large bodies of water, and in yards, park lawns, and farm fields.</p></div>
                </div>
                
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Regional Differences</h3><p>Canada Geese tend to be smaller as you move northward; plumage tends to be darker as you move westward.</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat (det)</h3>Canada Geese live in a great many habitats near water, grassy fields, and grain fields. Canada Geese are particularly drawn to lawns for two reasons: they can digest grass, and when they are feeding with their young, manicured lawns give them a wide, unobstructed view of any approaching predators. So they are especially abundant in parks, airports, golf courses, and other areas with expansive lawns. </div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Food</h3>In spring and summer, geese concentrate their feeding on grasses and sedges, including skunk cabbage leaves and eelgrass. During fall and winter, they rely more on berries and seeds, including agricultural grains, and seem especially fond of blueberries. They’re very efficient at removing kernels from dry corn cobs. Two subspecies have adapted to urban environments and graze on domesticated grasses year round.</div>
                    <div><h3>Nesting</h3>On the ground, usually on a muskrat mound or other slightly elevated site, near water. They prefer a spot from which they can have a fairly unobstructed view in many directions. Female selects the site and does much of nest construction. She adds down feathers and some body feathers beginning after the second egg is laid. She does all the incubation while her mate guards her and the nest. <br></div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior (det.)</h3>Canada Geese eat grain from fields, graze on grass, and dabble in shallow water by tipping forward and extending their necks underwater. During much of the year they associate in large flocks, and many of these birds may be related to one another. They mate for life with very low “divorce rates,” and pairs remain together throughout the year. Geese mate “assortatively,” larger birds choosing larger mates and smaller ones choosing smaller mates; in a given pair, the male is usually larger than the female. Most Canada Geese do not breed until their fourth year; less than 10 percent breed as yearlings, and most pair bonds are unstable until birds are at least two or three years old. Extra-pair copulations have been documented.</div>
                    <div><h3>Conservation</h3>Canada Geese are common and increased between 1966 and 2015, according to the North American Breeding Bird Survey. The total North American population in 2015 was between 4.2 million to over 5.6 million. The species rates a 6 out of 20 on the Continental Concern Score. It is not on the </div>
