This rusty-brown wren has black-and-white streaks down its back and a white eyebrow. It sings a rapid-fire gurgling, trilling, and buzzy song from the depths of the marsh where its secretive life unfolds. Under the cover of reeds, males build multiple nests and breed with more than one female. They also destroy eggs and nestlings of other Marsh Wrens and marsh-nesting birds.</p>

                    <div><h3>Size & Shape</h3><p><p>The Marsh Wren is a small, plump, round-bodied wren with a short tail that it often holds up almost vertically above its back. It has a thin bill and short wings. </p>

                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior</h3><p><p>Marsh Wrens bounce around with their tails cocked in marshes filled with cattails and rushes. They grasp stalks of vegetation, legs splayed with each foot wrapped around a different stalk. Males occasionally pop up to sing from taller cattails. They rapidly beat their wings to make short flights within the marsh.</p>
</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat</h3><p><p>Marsh Wrens occupy wetlands filled with cattails, sedges, bulrushes, and <em>Phragmites</em> as well as cordgrass-filled saltmarshes year-round. In the winter they also use brushy thickets near wetlands, tidal saltmarshes, and weedy agricultural canals. </p>

                    <div><h3>Regional Differences</h3><p><p>Multiple subspecies of Marsh Wrens occur throughout their range, and their taxonomy has yet to be fully evaluated. In general, individuals in the eastern United States are rustier and more brightly colored than individuals in the western U.S. Birds in the West also have a larger repertoire of songs that are harsher and more complex than those in the East (see <a href="https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Marsh_Wren/sounds">Sounds</a>). A small disjunct resident population also occurs in Mexico in the states of Hidalgo, Mexico, and Puebla. </p>

                    <div><h3>Food</h3><p>Marsh Wrens pick insects and spiders from stems and leaves of marsh vegetation. They tend to forage close to water, but occasionally fly up to catch a passing insect. </p></div>
                    <div><h3>Nesting</h3><p>Males build several nests within their territory, in cattails and bulrushes around 2â€“5 feet above the ground.</p><br></div>

                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior (det.)</h3><p>Marsh Wrens cling to stems of wetland vegetation, often with each foot on a different stalk shimmying up and down and belting out series of gurgling, buzzy trills. They tend to stay down in the reeds, but males sometimes pop up to sing on taller stems especially early in the breeding season. Displaying males also fly weakly above the marsh, fluttering downwards and dropping straight back into the reeds. Adults often return to the same breeding territories year after year. Males arrive on the breeding grounds first and begin building several dome-shaped nests. When a female arrives, he cocks his tail and sings. He then escorts her around to his nests, bowing and holding up his tail. Once the female selects the nest they both aggressively defend the territory, but males don't stick with just one female; they frequently mate with others. Males and females also destroy the eggs and nestlings of other Marsh Wrens and nesting birds, perhaps in a fight over resources.</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Conservation</h3><p>Marsh Wrens are common and their populations increased by 130% between 1966 and 2015, according to <a href="https://www.mbr-pwrc.usgs.gov/bbs/specl15.html">North American Breeding Bird Survey</a>. The estimated global breeding population is 9.4 million. The species rates a 7 out of 20 on the <a href="http://www.stateofthebirds.org/2016/overview/methods/">Continental Concern Score</a>, which means it is not on the <a href="https://www.partnersinflight.org/watch-list-categories/">Partners in Flight Watch List</a> and is a species of low conservation concern. Although populations appear stable, like other species that rely on marsh habitat, draining and filling of marshes could be problematic for Marsh Wrens.</p></div>
