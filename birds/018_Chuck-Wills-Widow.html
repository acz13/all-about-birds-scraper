                    <div><h3>Size & Shape</h3><p>The surprisingly large Chuck-will’s-widow has a huge flat head and long wings. It's significantly larger than Common Nighthawk and Whip-poor-will. </p></div>
                    <div><h3>Color Pattern</h3><p>Warm brown tones with intricately patterned feathers make them extremely well-camouflaged. The wings are entirely brown; the outer tail feathers have white inner webs that you might see as one flushes from a roost or passes through your headlights. More often, you won't see white in the tail—this helps separate it from Whip-poor-will, in which the white is more prominent. </p></div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior</h3><p>Calls at dusk, pre-dawn and at night. Chuck-will’s-widows often sit on the road and roadsides at night, where you'll occasionally spot them in headlights. Their eyes reflect a bright orange eyeshine. Also, sometimes seen at dusk gliding over trees giving their wing-clapping display or while hunting. </p></div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat</h3><p>Look for Chuck-will’s-widow roosting in dry woodlands in the southeast, from pine barrens to oak-hickory and mixed deciduous woodlands. </p></div>

                    <div><h3>Regional Differences</h3>None</div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat (det)</h3>Chuck-will's-widows breed in pine, oak-hickory, and other forests of the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic states. They tend to live in more open areas than the similar Whip-poor-will. In winter you can find them in brush, woodlands, hedgerows, thickets, and fields as far south as Colombia, Venezuela, and the Caribbean.</div>

                <div>
                    <div><h3>Food</h3>Chuck-will's-widows catch flying insects at night. They eat mainly moths, beetles—including June beetles, scarabs, longhorned beetles, and click beetles—and dragonflies. Very occasionally, they have been seen eating birds such as Hooded, Palm, Yellow, and Cape May Warblers, Common Yellowthroat, Swamp Sparrow, Carolina Wren, Cuban Emerald (a hummingbird), as well as bats.</div>
                    <div><h3>Nesting</h3>Nest sites are typically in dense thickets near openings such as road edges or forest clearings.<br></div>

                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior (det.)</h3>The Chuck-will's-widow's most apparent behavior is its incessant calling at night—the most typical experience people have with these birds. They do most of their foraging at dusk and dawn—though during full moons or under streetlights, when visibility is good, they may forage much of the night. They are buoyant and maneuverable in flight, catching flying insects with a short dive or chase followed by a snap of the bill. Long, stiff feathers around the mouth, called rictal bristles, help guide prey into their very wide gapes. Territorial males chase each other up to a quarter-mile while making a growling call. In courtship, males droop their wings, spread their tail feathers, ruffle their feathers and puff themselves up while calling to the female.</div>
                    <div><h3>Conservation</h3>Chuck-will's-widow numbers declined by about 2.3% per year between 1966 and 2015, resulting in a cumulative decline of 69%, according tot he North American Breeding Bird Survey. Partners in Flight estimates a global breeding population of 6 million with 100% spending some part of the year in the U.S., and 13% in Mexico. The species rates a 12 out of 20 on the Continental Concern Score. Chuck-will's-widow was on the </div>
