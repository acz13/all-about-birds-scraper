In the East, dark, glossy-blue males and brown females will peer from the entrances and chirp from the rooftops all summer. In the West, martins mainly still nest the old-fashioned way—in woodpecker holes. Our largest swallows, Purple Martins perform aerial acrobatics to snap up flying insects. At the end of the breeding season they gather in big flocks and make their way to South America.</p></div></div><div class="row"><ul class="LH-menu"><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Purple_Martin/lifehistory#habitat"><span>Habitat</span><span>Lakes and Ponds</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Purple_Martin/lifehistory#food"><span>Food</span><span>Insects</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Purple_Martin/lifehistory#nesting"><span>Nesting</span><span>Cavity</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Purple_Martin/lifehistory#behavior"><span>Behavior</span><span>Aerial Forager</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Purple_Martin/lifehistory#conservation"><span>Conservation</span><span>Low Concern</span></a></li></ul></div></div>

                    <div><h3>Size & Shape</h3><p>Purple Martins are very large, broad-chested swallows. They have stout, slightly hooked bills, short, forked tails, and long, tapered wings.</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Color Pattern</h3><p>Adult males are iridescent, dark blue-purple overall with brown-black wings and tail. Females and immatures are duller, with variable amounts of gray on the head and chest and a whitish lower belly.</p></div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior</h3><p>Purple Martins fly rapidly with a mix of flapping and gliding. They feed in midair, catching large, aerial insects such as dragonflies. Martins feed and roost in flocks, often mixed with other species of swallows. They often feed higher in the air than other swallows, which can make them tough to spot.</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat</h3><p>Purple Martins are colonial, with dozens of martins nesting in the same spot; they feed in open areas, especially near water. In the East they nest almost exclusively in nest boxes and martin houses; in the West you’ll find them nesting in natural cavities. </p></div>
                </div>
                
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Regional Differences</h3><p>Female Purple Martins in the West show more extensive white on their underparts than do eastern birds.</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat (det)</h3>Purple Martins forage over towns, cities, parks, open fields, dunes, streams, wet meadows, beaver ponds, and other open areas. In eastern North America they used to breed along forest edges and rivers, where dead snags offered woodpecker holes to nest in. But since humans began supplying nest boxes for them, eastern martins have become urbanites, living almost exclusively near cities and towns. In the West, martins have stuck with woodpecker holes in mountain forests or Pacific lowlands. Purple Martin wintering grounds are savannas and agricultural fields in Bolivia, Brazil, and elsewhere in South America. At night, wintering martins flock into cities and towns to roost, often in the trees of village plazas.</div>

                <div>
                    <div><h3>Food</h3>A year-round insectivore, the Purple Martin eats flying insects at altitudes higher than other swallows, often exceeding 150 feet and sometimes 500 feet or more off the ground. When they encounter prey, they turn suddenly sideways or upward, speed up, and then flare their tails as they trap the insect. Their menu includes beetles, flies, dragonflies, damselflies, leafhoppers, grasshoppers, crickets, butterflies, moths, wasps, bees, caddisflies, spiders, cicadas, termites, and mayflies. They feed during the day, rarely in groups but often in pairs (probably so the male can guard the female from mating with other males). Martins pick up small bits of gravel to help them digest insect exoskeletons.</div>
                    <div><h3>Nesting</h3>Both males and females visit several cavities before choosing a site (a female chooses her mate largely based on the nest site he occupies). The cavity is usually in a birdhouse, gourd, dead tree, saguaro cactus, building, or cliff, but sometimes in other structures like traffic lights, street lamps, dock pilings, or oil pumps. Birdhouses are variable but most are made of wood or aluminum, contain 8–12 rooms, and hang from wires or sit atop poles in open areas.<br></div>

                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior (det.)</h3>Purple Martins fly with quick flaps and glides, outlining big circles in the sky as they hunt insects. They rarely land on the ground except to collect nesting material and pick up grit to aid their digestion. Males defend small nesting (but not foraging) territories from other males and females do the same with other females. In eastern populations, each territory includes several compartments within a bird house (and occasionally several bird houses), but most birds gradually give up portions of their territory as more and more males arrive. The female usually defends a smaller territory, which usually shrinks down to the size of its own nest compartment by egg-laying time. Physical fights usually only break out if one bird goes into another bird’s nest compartment. Martins pair up with one male and one female per nest, but sometimes two females may settle into different compartments of one male’s territory. Both sexes frequently mate outside of their pair bond. Adults form flocks as soon as nestlings fledge, and congregate in large roosts throughout the winter. </div>
                    <div><h3>Conservation</h3>Purple Martins are fairly common birds (especially in the Southeast), but their numbers declined by almost 1% per year between 1966 and 2015, resulting in a cumulative decline of 37%, according to the North American Breeding Bird Survey. Partners in Flight estimates the global breeding population at 7 million with 90% breeding in or migrating through the U.S., 7 % in Mexico, and 3% breeding in Canada. The species rates an 9 out of 20 on the Continental Concern Score. Purple Martin is not on the </div>
