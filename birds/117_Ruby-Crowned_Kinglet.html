Its habit of constantly flicking its wings is a key identification clue. Smaller than a warbler or chickadee, this plain green-gray bird has a white eyering and a white bar on the wing.

                    <div><h3>Size & Shape</h3><p>Kinglets are tiny songbirds with relatively large heads, almost no neck, and thin tails. They have very small, thin, straight bills. </p></div>
                    <div><h3>Color Pattern</h3><p>Ruby-crowned Kinglets are olive-green birds with a prominent white eyering and white wingbar. This wingbar contrasts with an adjacent blackish bar in the wing. The “ruby crown” of the male is only occasionally visible.</p></div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior</h3><p>These are restless, acrobatic birds that move quickly through foliage, typically at lower and middle levels. They flick their wings almost constantly as they go.</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat</h3><p>Ruby-crowned Kinglets breed in tall, dense conifer forests such as spruce, fir, and tamarack. In winter and during migration, also look for them in shrubby habitats, deciduous forests, parks, and suburbs.</p></div>
                </div>
                
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Regional Differences</h3><p>Ruby-crowned Kinglets in coastal southern Alaska and British Columbia are slightly smaller and darker colored than elsewhere in their range.</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat (det)</h3>In summer, Ruby-Crowned Kinglets are common in spruce-fir forests in the northwestern United States and across Canada. They also live in mixed woods, isolated trees in meadows, coniferous and deciduous forests, mountain-shrub habitat, and floodplain forests of oak, pine, spruce or aspen. These birds nest high in trees, and so prefer older, taller, and denser stands to younger ones. During migration and winter they are common in woods and thickets across most of the continent.</div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Food</h3>Ruby-Crowned Kinglets prey on spiders, pseudoscorpions, and many types of insects, including aphids, wasps, ants, and bark beetles. Kinglets usually forage in high tree foliage, hovering and pecking in order to glean insects from the surface of leaves and branches. These birds also eat a small amount of seeds and fruit, from poison-oak berries to the pulp of dogwood berries.</div>
                    <div><h3>Nesting</h3>Ruby-Crowned Kinglets make their nests in trees, occasionally as high up as 100 feet. Females choose a nest site near the tree trunk or suspended from small twigs and branchlets. Because of the nest site's height and often remote location, not much is known about kinglet nesting habits. Their nest sites, chosen by the females, are protected and often hidden by overhanging foliage.<br></div>

                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior (det.)</h3>Breeding pairs of Ruby-Crowned Kinglets stay together for two months, until their chicks fledge. Ruby-Crowned Kinglets use their long, bubbly, and amazingly loud songs to establish territories; this is more energy efficient than chasing and less dangerous than fighting. They can be recognized by a constant flicking of their wings. </div>
                    <div><h3>Conservation</h3>Ruby-crowned Kinglets are common and overall, despite regional increases and declines, their numbers were stable between 1966 and 2015, according to the North American Breeding Bird Survey. Partners in Flight estimates a global breeding population of 90 million with 72% spending some part of the year in the U.S., 81% in Canada, and 26% wintering in Mexico. The species rates a 6 out of 20 on the Continental Concern Score. Ruby-crowned Kinglet is not on the </div>
