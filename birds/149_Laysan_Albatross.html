These expert soarers can travel hundreds of miles per day with barely a wingbeat. They nest on islands of the tropical Pacific, but they may head out to Japan, the Aleutian Islands, or California to feed. Laysan Albatrosses are numerous, though they face threats from longline fishing, plastic trash in the ocean, and predation by dogs, rats, and cats.</p></div></div><div class="row"><ul class="LH-menu"><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Laysan_Albatross/lifehistory#habitat"><span>Habitat</span><span>Oceans</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Laysan_Albatross/lifehistory#food"><span>Food</span><span>Fish</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Laysan_Albatross/lifehistory#nesting"><span>Nesting</span><span>Ground</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Laysan_Albatross/lifehistory#behavior"><span>Behavior</span><span>Soaring</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Laysan_Albatross/lifehistory#conservation"><span>Conservation</span><span>Restricted Range</span></a></li></ul></div></div>

                    <div><h3>Size & Shape</h3><p>Laysan Albatrosses are very large seabirds (though they are among the smaller albatrosses). They have very long, very narrow wings. The neck is thick and the head is large.</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Color Pattern</h3><p>Laysan Albatrosses are white-headed birds with dark gray-brown upperwings and mostly white underwings (with variable dark markings). The underparts are clean white. They have a dark patch around the eye. In flight, note the dark back, white rump, and dark tail.</p></div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior</h3><p>They fly by dynamic soaring: gliding low over the waves and then wheeling up into the sky to take advantage of the wind. They rarely flap their wings. They feed by sitting on the water, often at night, catching squid and other small prey with their bills.</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat</h3><p>Laysan Albatrosses spend most of their time on the open Pacific Ocean, spanning tropical waters up to the southern Bering Sea. They nest on open, sandy or grassy islands, mostly in the Hawaiian Island chain.</p></div>

                    <div><h3>Regional Differences</h3>None</div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat (det)</h3>Laysan Albatrosses range across the northern Pacific Ocean from about the latitude of Costa Rica to the Aleutian Islands and southern Bering Sea. They tend to forage in colder, food-rich waters, although they have been found in waters ranging from about 35°F to 79°F. The birds nest on open, grassy or sandy expanses of islands—particularly Midway Atoll and Laysan Island (which together account for about 94 percent of breeding pairs), other small Hawaiian Islands, the larger islands of Kauai and Oahu, and a few sites off Mexico and Japan. </div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Food</h3>Laysan Albatrosses eat mainly squid as well as fish eggs, crustaceans, floating carrion, and some discards from fishing boats. They feed by sitting on the water and plunging with their beaks to seize prey near the surface. Adults with chicks to feed take foraging trips that last up to 17 days and travel 1,600 miles away from their nest (straight-line distance). </div>
                    <div><h3>Nesting</h3>Females place their nests on sparsely vegetated ground, typically close to a small shrub if available. <br></div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior (det.)</h3>The classic behavior of albatrosses is dynamic soaring—a flight style marked by very infrequent wingbeats and masterful soaring. The bird takes advantage of wind speed and direction changes at different heights to fly great distances with very slight alterations of their wing position. On the ground these big birds walk ponderously and usually have to run along the ground, into the wind, to be able to take off. Pairs tend to form lasting bonds. They return to the colony beginning in November, where they perform elaborate courtship displays. These include coordinated movements in which the birds touch bills, spread one or both wings, bob their heads, place their bill under one wing, and pause with their bill pointed at the sky. After mating, both birds leave the island, with the female returning first to lay a single egg. It can take up to a decade for a young albatross to successfully reproduce: 1-year-olds usually don’t return to the colony at all; 3- and 4-year-olds return to attempt breeding but usually are not successful until they are 9 or 10. They often breed in colonies alongside Black-footed Albatrosses. Introduced dogs, cats, rats, and mongoose threaten eggs, nestlings, and adult birds; on the water they are vulnerable to tiger sharks.</div>
                    <div><h3>Conservation</h3>Laysan Albatrosses are numerous, but as with all albatross species there are serious threats to their population, and this species is on the </div>
