Roadrunners reach two feet from sturdy bill to white tail tip, with a bushy blue-black crest and mottled plumage that blends well with dusty shrubs. As they run, they hold their lean frames nearly parallel to the ground and rudder with their long tails. They have recently extended their range eastward into Missouri and Louisiana.</p></div></div><div class="row"><ul class="LH-menu"><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Greater_Roadrunner/lifehistory#habitat"><span>Habitat</span><span>Scrub</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Greater_Roadrunner/lifehistory#food"><span>Food</span><span>Omnivore</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Greater_Roadrunner/lifehistory#nesting"><span>Nesting</span><span>Tree</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Greater_Roadrunner/lifehistory#behavior"><span>Behavior</span><span>Ground Forager</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Greater_Roadrunner/lifehistory#conservation"><span>Conservation</span><span>Low Concern</span></a></li></ul></div></div>

                    <div><h3>Size & Shape</h3><p>Greater Roadrunners are large cuckoos with a distinctive shape: long legs, a very long, straight tail, and a long neck. The head has a short crest and the bill is long, heavy, and slightly downcurved. </p></div>
                    <div><h3>Color Pattern</h3><p>They are tan or brown with extensive blackish streaking on the upperparts and chest. The crown is black with small, pale spots, and they have a patch of bare, blue skin behind the eye. The wings are dark with white highlights. </p></div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior</h3><p>Greater Roadrunners spend most of their lives on the ground hunting lizards, small mammals, and birds. They are very fast runners, leaning over parallel to the ground with their tails streaming behind them. They are weak fliers, but you may see them perched above the ground on fence posts and sometimes telephone wires.</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat</h3><p>Greater Roadrunners are characteristic birds of the hot, shrubby expanses of the Desert Southwest. They aren’t restricted to deserts, though: look for them in open country with patches of shrubs or small trees almost as far east as the Mississippi River.</p></div>
                </div>

                    <div><h3>Regional Differences</h3>None</div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat (det)</h3>Greater Roadrunners occur throughout the Southwest and into northern California in semi-open, scrubby habitat from below sea level to nearly 10,000 feet. Habitats include areas dominated by creosote, mesquite, chaparral, and tamarisk, as well as grasslands, riparian woodlands and canyons. At higher elevations roadrunners live in pinyon-juniper woodlands and cholla grasslands. Greater Roadrunners have expanded their range into southwest Missouri, western Arkansas, eastern Oklahoma, and Louisiana, where they occupy less typical habitat that includes red juniper landscapes, scrubby woods, loblolly pine forests and upland hardwood stands. Roadrunners avoid heavily forested and densely populated areas, but can tolerate sparser suburban development and open farmland.</div>

                <div>
                    <div><h3>Food</h3>Greater Roadrunners eat mostly animals, including almost anything they can catch: small mammals, reptiles, frogs, toads, insects, centipedes, scorpions, and birds. Roadrunners also eat carrion and prey on bird eggs and chicks. They kill rattlesnakes by pecking them repeatedly in the head. They slam large prey, such as rodents and lizards, against a rock or the ground multiple times to break down the bones and elongate the victim, making it easier to swallow. These opportunistic predators have also been known to grab birds from backyard feeders or nest boxes. In winter, fruit, seeds, and other plant material make up 10 percent of the roadrunner’s diet.</div>
                    <div><h3>Nesting</h3>The pair chooses a nest site 3–10 feet or more off the ground, on a horizontal branch or in the crotch of a sturdy bush, cactus, or small tree. The shaded, well-concealed nest is often located next to a path or streambed that the Greater Roadrunners use when carrying nest-building material and food for nestlings.<br></div>

                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior (det.)</h3>True to its name, the Greater Roadrunner races along roads, streambeds, and well-worn paths, defending its large territory and chasing lizards, rodents, and insects. While on the move they startle and flush a meal by flashing the white spots on their open wings. Roadrunners can also jump straight up to snag insects, bats, and even hummingbirds in flight. Although agile on the ground, roadrunners don’t fly well. A threat may trigger a short, low burst of flight to seek a hiding place; otherwise, flying is limited to gliding from a nest or perch to the ground, or between perches. In the morning, roadrunners often “sunbathe” to warm up after a cold night in the desert: with its back to the sun, the bird raises the feathers across its back and wings to expose its heat-absorbent black skin. In winter, birds may sunbathe several times a day. Male roadrunners perch atop fence posts and rocks, calling out with a mournful </div>
                    <div><h3>Conservation</h3>Greater Roadrunners are numerous and their breeding populations are stable, according to the North American Breeding Bird Survey. Partners in Flight estimates the global breeding population at 1.1 million, with 62% occurring in the U.S. and the other 38% in Mexico. The species rates a 9 out of 20 on the Continental Concern Score and are not on the not on the </div>
