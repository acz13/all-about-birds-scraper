                    <div><h3>Size & Shape</h3><p>The Chipping Sparrow is a slender, fairly long-tailed sparrow with a medium-sized bill that is a bit small for a sparrow. Learning the shape of this classic <em>Spizella</em> sparrow is a key step in mastering sparrow identification.</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Color Pattern</h3><p>Summer Chipping Sparrows look clean and crisp, with frosty underparts, pale face, black line through the eye, topped off with a bright rusty crown. In winter, Chipping Sparrows are subdued, buff brown, with darkly streaked upperparts. The black line through the eye is still visible, and the cap is a warm but more subdued reddish brown.</p></div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior</h3><p>Chipping Sparrows feed on the ground, take cover in shrubs, and sing from the tops of small trees (often evergreens). You’ll often see loose groups of them flitting up from open ground. When singing, they cling to high outer limbs. On the ground they hop or run through grasses searching for seeds.</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat</h3><p>Look for Chipping Sparrows in open woodlands and forests with grassy clearings across North America. You’ll also see them in parks, along roadsides, and in your backyard, particularly if you have feeders and trees.</p></div>

                    <div><h3>Regional Differences</h3>None</div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat (det)</h3>You’ll find Chipping Sparrows around trees, even though these birds spend a lot of time foraging on the ground. Look for them in grassy forests, woodlands and edges, parks and shrubby or tree-lined backyards. Chipping Sparrows seem to gravitate toward evergreens in places where these trees are available. They also use aspen, birch, oak, pecan, and eucalyptus trees. In the mountains, you can find these birds all the way up to treeline.</div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Food</h3>Chipping Sparrows mainly eat seeds of a great variety of grasses and herbs. During the breeding season they also hunt for protein-rich insects, and these form a large part of their summer diet. Chipping Sparrows sometimes eat small fruits such as cherries.</div>
                    <div><h3>Nesting</h3>Females typically build their nests between 3 and 10 feet off the ground, hidden in foliage at the tip of a branch. They gravitate toward evergreen trees, but also nest in crabapples, honeysuckle tangles, maples, ornamental shrubs, and other deciduous species. Females can be finicky about placement, often beginning to build a nest, then leaving to begin in another spot.<br></div>

                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior (det.)</h3>In summer, male Chipping Sparrows defend territories against other Chipping Sparrows, but often tolerate other species as long as they don’t go too near the nest. After the breeding season, Chipping Sparrows form flocks of several dozen, foraging together among grasses and at bird feeders. Their flight pattern is energetic, straight, and only slightly undulating.</div>
                    <div><h3>Conservation</h3>Chipping Sparrows are common across the continent, but overall the species declined by about 36% between 1966 and 2015, according to the North American Breeding Bird Survey. Partners in Flight estimates the global breeding population at 230 million, with 38% spending some part of the year in the U.S., 49% in Mexico, and 56% breeding in Canada. The species rates an 8 out of 20 on the Continental Concern Score. Chipping Sparrow is not on the </div>
