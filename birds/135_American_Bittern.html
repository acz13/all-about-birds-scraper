This streaky, brown and buff heron can materialize among the reeds, and disappear as quickly, especially when striking a concealment pose with neck stretched and bill pointed skyward. These stealthy carnivores stand motionless amid tall marsh vegetation, or patiently stalk fish, frogs, and insects. They are at their most noticeable in spring, when the marshes resound with their odd booming calls that sounds like the gulps of a thirsty giant.</p></div></div><div class="row"><ul class="LH-menu"><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/American_Bittern/lifehistory#habitat"><span>Habitat</span><span>Marshes</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/American_Bittern/lifehistory#food"><span>Food</span><span>Fish</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/American_Bittern/lifehistory#nesting"><span>Nesting</span><span>Ground</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/American_Bittern/lifehistory#behavior"><span>Behavior</span><span>Stalking</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/American_Bittern/lifehistory#conservation"><span>Conservation</span><span>Low Concern</span></a></li></ul></div></div>

                    <div><h3>Size & Shape</h3><p>American Bitterns are medium-sized herons with thick, compact bodies. They have shorter legs and thicker necks than typical herons and a slightly hunched posture. The daggerlike bill is long, straight, and sharply pointed. The wings are broad but the wingtips are somewhat pointed.</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Color Pattern</h3><p>American Bitterns are mostly warm brown, buff, and white. They are strongly streaked, especially on the neck, and they can be very hard to see against marsh vegetation. In flight the dark outer wings contrast sharply with the brown of the rest of the bird. </p></div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior</h3><p>Bitterns are stealth predators and typically stand motionless as they wait for prey to approach, or stalk it with barely perceptible motions. They adopt a classic pose when alarmed, with the beak pointing straight up, helping this streaky bird blend in with its reedy background. They tend to forage alone.</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat</h3><p>Look for American Bitterns in shallow freshwater marshes, typically toward the margins and among reeds and other vegetation; they are rarely out in the open.</p></div>
                </div>

                    <div><h3>Regional Differences</h3>None</div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat (det)</h3>American Bitterns breed mainly in freshwater marshes with tall vegetation. You can find them in wetlands of many sizes and kinds, typically less densely vegetated and shallower than wetlands used by the Least Bittern. In winter they move to areas where water bodies don't freeze, especially near the coast, where they occasionally use brackish marshes. Managed wetlands such as wildlife refuges seem to be important for wintering American Bitterns. Wintering birds may also forage in dry grasslands and other terrestrial habitats.</div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Food</h3>American Bitterns eat insects, crustaceans, fish, amphibians, reptiles, and small mammals. Their most common insect prey include water striders, giant water bugs, water beetles, water scorpions, grasshoppers, and especially dragonflies, which the birds sometimes manage to capture in midair. Frequently consumed fish include eels, catfish, pickerel, sunfish, suckers, perch, killifish, and sticklebacks. Rayfish, crabs, frogs, tadpoles, salamanders, garter snakes, water snakes, and meadow voles round out the diet. American Bitterns usually forage in dim light, at shorelines and the fringes of vegetated areas. A foraging bird may sway its neck, perhaps to see past glare from the surface of shallow water, or to warm up its muscles for a quick strike. A characteristic strategy is to stand stock-still with bill held horizontal, gradually aiming the bill downward with nearly imperceptible movements—until, with a sudden darting motion, the bittern seizes the prey in its bill, bites or shakes it to death, and swallows it head first. Indigestible parts of prey animals are regurgitated as pellets.</div>
                    <div><h3>Nesting</h3>American Bitterns usually build their nests among thick stands of cattails, bulrushes, and sedges that grow out of shallow water. Less commonly, they nest on dry ground, in grassland areas dense with tall herbaceous plants. Limited research suggests that the females choose the nest sites.<br></div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior (det.)</h3>American Bitterns are solitary foragers, standing motionless or walking slowly with outspread toes in search of food. They hunt during the day and especially at dawn and dusk. Possibly the most famous aspect of bittern behavior is the stance it assumes when it perceives a threat. It points its bill skyward, elongates its body, and even sways with the breeze, all to blend in with its reedy surroundings. This pose is so ingrained that bitterns sometimes adopt it even when they’re out in the open. American Bitterns don't do much socializing apart from migrating in small groups, mating, and facing off over territories—which can be dramatic. Competing males hunker down and approach each other while displaying white plumes between their shoulders. This can escalate into an airborne chase, with the combatants spiraling upwards, trying to stab each other with their bills. A male about to copulate lowers and pumps his head, and fluffs the white feathers that usually lie concealed beneath his wings. Copulation lasts about 15 seconds. Males and females have little to do with each other apart from copulation, although a female may nest near a "booming" male as a way of distracting predators from her brood. </div>
                    <div><h3>Conservation</h3>American Bitterns are fairly common, but their numbers are declining in some regions of the U.S. and Canada, according according to the North American Breeding Bird Survey. The survey estimates a decline in U.S. populations by about 43% between 1966 and 2015. The species rates a 12 out of 20 on the Continental Concern Score, and is not on the </div>
