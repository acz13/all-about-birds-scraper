This long-legged wader glides through shallow waters swishing its slender, upturned bill from side to side to catch aquatic invertebrates. It dons a sophisticated look for summer with a black-and-white body and a rusty head and neck. During the winter the head and neck turn a grayish white, but the bird loses none of its elegance as it forages along coastal waters or rests while standing on one leg. </p>

</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Color Pattern</h3><p><p>Breeding birds have a chic rusty head and neck that turns grayish white after breeding. A black patch on the back and black-and-white wings mark its largely white body. The legs are bluish gray. </p>

                    <div><h3>Behavior</h3><p><p>Wades through shallow water sweeping its bill side to side for aquatic invertebrates. Often shakes its foot with each step to remove mud from its foot. </p>
</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat</h3><p><p>Found in wetlands including shallow fresh and saltwater wetlands, salt ponds, impoundments, and evaporation ponds. Forages in open water generally less than 8 inches deep. During winter also uses intertidal mudflats, tidal lagoons, brackish impoundments, sewage ponds, rice fields, and flooded pastures. </p>

                    <div><h3>Habitat (det)</h3><p>American Avocets forage in shallow fresh and saltwater wetlands, salt ponds, impoundments, and evaporation ponds. They nest in areas with little or no vegetation along dikes and islands. During winter they also use intertidal mudflats, tidal lagoons, brackish impoundments, sewage ponds, rice fields, and flooded pastures. </p></div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Food</h3><p>American Avocets forage for aquatic invertebrates in shallow water while wading or swimming. Their diet consists of beetles, water boatmen, midges, brine flies, fairy shrimp, water fleas, amphipods, and more. They also eat small fish and seeds from aquatic plants. They capture aquatic invertebrates in the water column by sweeping their bill side to side, a signature behavior called scything. With each step they put their slightly open bill in the water and move it in the direction of the outstretched foot, alternating sides with each step. They also capture prey by pecking and plunging. Pecking involves lunging out with their bill to peck at prey within the water column or in the wetland bottom. Individuals also plunge their head and neck underwater to grab prey in the water column. Foraging methods vary by time of day, flock size, and date. Scything and pecking occur more often during the day, while plunging is more common at night.</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Nesting</h3><p>Male and female avocets select a nest site together. The male leads the female around making scrapes in the ground, until they both choose a spot to nest. They typically nest on islands or dikes, placing the nest on the ground with little or no surrounding vegetation. </p><br></div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior (det.)</h3><p>American Avocets wade in shallow wetlands often less than 8 inches deep, but they also swim in deeper waters. On the breeding grounds, avocets breed in loose colonies and defend the nest site. Intruders are met with outstretched necks or a crouch-run where they ruffle their feathers, crouch down, and run at the intruder. Upon the arrival of a terrestrial predator, avocets may approach with a teetering gait and outstretched wings, as if on a tightrope. They also try to distract the predator by crouching on the ground as if incubating, only to move and crouch again in a new location. In its pre-copulation display, the male American Avocet preens himself with water, gradually gaining intensity to the point of frenzied splashing just before mating with the female. After mating, the pair intertwines their necks with their bills crossed and runs forward. The pair stays together for a single breeding season. One notable display, known as “circling,” occurs before and during nesting and involves two pairs, or a pair and a third individual. Individuals face each other in a circle and stretch their bills toward each other while calling and rotating in a circle. On the wintering grounds they forage and rest in flocks often with other shorebirds, especially the Black-necked Stilt.</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Conservation</h3><p>American Avocets are common and their populations have been stable between 1966 and 2015, according to the <a href="https://www.mbr-pwrc.usgs.gov/bbs/specl15.html">North American Breeding Bird Survey</a>. <a href="http://pif.birdconservancy.org/ACAD/Database.aspx">Partners in Flight</a> estimates the global breeding population at 450,000. The species rates an 11 out of 20 on the <a href="http://www.stateofthebirds.org/2016/overview/methods/">Continental Concern Score</a>, which means it is not on the <a href="https://www.partnersinflight.org/watch-list-categories/">Partners in Flight Watch List</a> and is a species of low conservation concern. People drained or converted wetlands on a large scale in the early twentieth century, causing population declines as traditional breeding sites were eliminated. Creation of sewage ponds, agricultural evaporation ponds, rice fields, and salt ponds now provide additional breeding habitat to counteract past losses. Many wetlands in the western United States however, are contaminated with selenium that leaches from the soil following irrigation, which can cause low reproductive success and embryo deformities. Methylmercury, a pollutant associated mainly with the burning of coal, also causes chick deaths in some wetlands.</p></div>
