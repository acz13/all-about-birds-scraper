Groups sweep their spoonbills through shallow fresh or salt waters snapping up crustaceans and fish. They fly with necks outstretched, to and from foraging and nesting areas along the coastal southeastern U.S., and south to South America. These social birds nest and roost in trees and shrubs with other large wading birds.</p>

                    <div><h3>Size & Shape</h3><p><p>Roseate Spoonbills are medium-sized waterbirds with a football-shaped body and long legs. The long bill that is flattened into a spoon at the end protrudes from their small head. They fly with their long necks outstretched and often rest with it curled into an S.</p>
</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Color Pattern</h3><p><p>Roseate Spoonbills are pale pink birds with brighter pink shoulders and rump. They have a white neck and a partially feathered, yellowish green head from which their red eyes shine. Juveniles are paler pink and have a completely feathered head for 3 years until they attain adult breeding plumage. </p>
</p></div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior</h3><p><p>Roseate Spoonbills wade through shallow water swinging their head side to side with their bill under the water feeling for prey. They tend to forage with their bodies held in a horizontal position just above the water with head hanging down. They fly with the neck outstretched, dipping slightly below the body. Spoonbills forage, roost, and nest in groups often with other ibises, herons, and egrets. </p>
</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat</h3><p><p>Roseate Spoonbills forage in the shallows of fresh, brackish, and marine waters including bays, mangroves, forested swamps, and wetlands. They nest and roost in trees and shrubs along the water's edge. </p>
</p></div>
                </div>
                
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Regional Differences</h3>None</div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat (det)</h3><p>Roseate Spoonbills forage in the shallows of fresh, brackish, and marine waters with good sources of aquatic invertebrates. These include bays and mangroves to forested swamps and roadside ditches. They nest and roost in trees and shrubs along the water's edge. </p></div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Food</h3><p>Roseate Spoonbills forage in shallow waters typically less than 5 inches deep. They sweep their partly opened spoon-shaped bill through the water, feeling and looking for crustaceans such as shrimp, prawns, aquatic insects, and fish. Once they feel the prey on their bill they snap it closed, often swallowing the item whole.</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Nesting</h3><p>Roseate Spoonbills nest in colonies with egrets, ibises, and herons, typically on islands or over standing water. They nest in mangroves, Brazilian pepperbush, willows, sea myrtle, and other shrubs near the water. They tend to put their nests in the shadiest part of the tree or shrub, up to 16 feet high. </p><br></div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior (det.)</h3><p>Roseate Spoonbills slowly walk through shallow water with their bodies held horizontally and their spoon-shaped bill underwater feeling for prey. They sleep while standing, often on one leg with the head tucked under a shoulder. Roseate Spoonbills are social birds that gather in small to large (anywhere from 2 to around 400) groups when feeding and roosting. They fly to and from feeding and roosting areas with slow and deep wingbeats with their legs and neck fully extended. When foraging spoonbills spot a group of spoonbills flying overhead they stick their necks and bills straight up into the air in a posture called sky gazing. Spoonbills share the roosting and nesting colony with egrets, herons, and ibises. At colonies males bob their heads up and down while shaking nearby twigs to get the attention of a female. Interested pairs may bite each other's bills or may raise their outstretched wings above their body. Once paired, males present females with sticks, which they shake while holding them in their bills. Pairs generally stay together only for one breeding season. </p></div>
                    <div><h3>Conservation</h3><p>Roseate Spoonbills nest and forage in areas that can be difficult to reach, so obtaining an accurate estimate of their population is difficult. The best available estimates come from the North American Breeding Bird Survey and Partners in Flight. According to the <a href="https://www.mbr-pwrc.usgs.gov/bbs/specl15.html">North American Breeding Bird Survey</a> their populations have increased by nearly 6.5% between 1966 and 2015. <a href="http://pif.birdconservancy.org/ACAD/Database.aspx">Partners in Flight</a> estimates the global breeding population at 120,000 individuals. The species rates a 10 out of 20 on the <a href="http://www.stateofthebirds.org/2016/overview/methods/">Continental Concern Score</a>, which means it is not on the <a href="https://www.partnersinflight.org/watch-list-categories/">Partners in Flight Watch List</a> and is a species of low conservation concern. In Florida, much of their nesting habitat occurs in protected areas including the Everglades National Park and national wildlife refuges, but their foraging areas are not always under protection and can be affected by changes in water management that increase salinity and affect food availability. Nesting spoonbills are also vulnerable to human disturbance from boating and other recreation activities that can result in nest abandonment. </p></div>
