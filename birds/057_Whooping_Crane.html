It's also among our rarest birds and a testament to the tenacity and creativity of conservation biologists. The species declined to around 20 birds in the 1940s but, through captive breeding, wetland management, and an innovative program that teaches young cranes how to migrate, numbers have risen to about 600 today. </p></div></div><div class="row"><ul class="LH-menu"><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Whooping_Crane/lifehistory#habitat"><span>Habitat</span><span>Marshes</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Whooping_Crane/lifehistory#food"><span>Food</span><span>Omnivore</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Whooping_Crane/lifehistory#nesting"><span>Nesting</span><span>Ground</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Whooping_Crane/lifehistory#behavior"><span>Behavior</span><span>Probing</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Whooping_Crane/lifehistory#conservation"><span>Conservation</span><span>Restricted Range</span></a></li></ul></div></div>

                    <div><h3>Size & Shape</h3><p>Whooping Cranes are very large, tall birds with long necks and long legs. The bill is stout and straight; the overall slender body widens to a plump “bustle” at the tail. In flight the wings are broad and the neck is fully extended. </p></div>
                    <div><h3>Color Pattern</h3><p>Adults are bright white birds with accents of red on the head. The legs, bill, and wingtips are black. Immatures are whitish below but mottled brownish-rusty above. </p></div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior</h3><p>Whooping Cranes move at a stately pace, browsing and probing for food rather than hunting patiently and stealthily like a heron. They tend to occur in small flocks (or among much larger numbers of Sandhill Cranes) rather than singly.</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat</h3><p>Whooping Cranes breed in shallow, grassy wetlands interspersed with grasslands or scattered evergreens. During migration they stop over on wide shallow river flats. They winter mainly in coastal marshes and estuaries. They sometimes forage at crop fields.</p></div>
                </div>
                
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Regional Differences</h3>None</div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat (det)</h3>The only remaining naturally occurring Whooping Crane population spends the winter on the Gulf Coast, primarily in Texas's Aransas National Wildlife Refuge, and breeds in Canada's Northwest Territories and Alberta, mainly in Wood Buffalo National Park. Surrounded by the headwaters of four rivers, the Canadian breeding grounds lie on poorly drained soil interspersed with shallow wetlands. The Whooping Cranes nest in potholes dominated by bulrushes and containing other aquatic plants such as cattails, sedge, and muskgrass. These wetlands are divided by narrow ridges that support white and black spruce, tamarack, willows, dwarf birch, Labrador tea, and bearberry. On their Texas wintering grounds, Whooping Cranes spend their time on estuarine marshes, shallow bays, and tidal flats, sometimes venturing to nearby farmland. Salt grass, saltwort, smooth cordgrass, glasswort, and sea oxeye dominate the marshes, with Gulf cordgrass on the margins. Farther inland in their range are sandy, gently rolling grasslands with live oak, red bay, and bluestem plants. Migrating birds feed in croplands and roost in shallow, freshwater wetlands. </div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Food</h3>Whooping Cranes eat invertebrates, small vertebrates, and plant material, which they find on the ground and in shallow water. They peck and probe sandy or flooded soils to find prey underground. They also glean insects, berries, and seeds from low vegetation and take prey from the soil surface, using their bills to stab larger animals. The Canada breeding population eats mollusks, crustaceans, aquatic insects, minnows, frogs, snakes, mice, voles, aquatic tubers, and berries, while the Wisconsin breeding population eats mostly aquatic animals. Whooping Cranes also eat waste grains including barley, wheat, and corn from harvested fields, particularly during migration. On the Gulf Coast they feed in brackish bays, marshes, salt flats, and flooded or burned uplands away from human disturbance, eating mostly blue crabs, clams, and other animal foods, along with some plant material such as wolfberry, cranberry, acorns, cordgrass, marsh onions, and prairie lily.</div>
                    <div><h3>Nesting</h3>Pairs choose nest sites in shallow water of marshes, sloughs, or lake margins, frequently on small islands. They often take advantage of vegetation that hides the nest and incubating parent from predators. Each year the pair chooses a new nest site, sometimes in the same vicinity.<br></div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior (det.)</h3>Whooping Cranes are monogamous, forming pairs at the age of 2 or 3 years and mating for life. Courting pairs perform an elaborate, energetic dance display in which they leap, flap their wings, toss their heads, and even fling feathers and grass. Each breeding pair has a territory defended primarily by the male, who may attack intruding Whooping Cranes by running, flapping, hissing, stabbing, or jumping and slashing with his feet. New pairs often establish a territory near their parents. Whooping Cranes live and travel alone, in pairs, as families, or in small flocks of up to 7 birds, and sometimes flock with Sandhill Cranes. They may ignore or pursue other nearby birds, cattle, and deer. They spend their time on the ground and in shallow water, never perching in trees. They learn migration routes and nesting locations from other cranes (or from researchers in ultralight aircraft, as part of reintroduction efforts). Their strong homing instinct limits their dispersal to new habitat.</div>
