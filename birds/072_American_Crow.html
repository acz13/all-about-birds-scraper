They are common sights in treetops, fields, and roadsides, and in habitats ranging from open woods and empty beaches to town centers. They usually feed on the ground and eat almost anything – typically earthworms, insects and other small animals, seeds, and fruit but also garbage, carrion, and chicks they rob from nests. Their flight style is unique, a patient, methodical flapping that is rarely broken up with glides. </p></div></div><div class="row"><ul class="LH-menu"><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/American_Crow/lifehistory#habitat"><span>Habitat</span><span>Open Woodlands</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/American_Crow/lifehistory#food"><span>Food</span><span>Omnivore</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/American_Crow/lifehistory#nesting"><span>Nesting</span><span>Tree</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/American_Crow/lifehistory#behavior"><span>Behavior</span><span>Ground Forager</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/American_Crow/lifehistory#conservation"><span>Conservation</span><span>Low Concern</span></a></li></ul></div></div>

                    <div><h3>Size & Shape</h3><p>A large, long-legged, thick-necked bird with a heavy, straight bill. In flight, the wings are fairly broad and rounded with the wingtip feathers spread like fingers. The short tail is rounded or squared off at the end.</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Color Pattern</h3><p>American Crows are all black, even the legs and bill. When crows molt, the old feathers can appear brownish or scaly compared to the glossy new feathers.</p></div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior</h3><p>American Crows are very social, sometimes forming flocks in the thousands. Inquisitive and sometimes mischievous, crows are good learners and problem-solvers, often raiding garbage cans and picking over discarded food containers. They’re also aggressive and often chase away larger birds including hawks, owls and herons.</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat</h3><p>American Crows are common birds of fields, open woodlands, and forests. They thrive around people, and you’ll often find them in agricultural fields, lawns, parking lots, athletic fields, roadsides, towns, and city garbage dumps.</p></div>
                </div>
                
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Regional Differences</h3><p>Crows in the West are slightly smaller than eastern crows (noticeably so for people with trained eyes). Crows in Florida are small with large feet.</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat (det)</h3>American Crows are highly adaptable and will live in any open place that offers a few trees to perch in and a reliable source of food. Regularly uses both natural and human created habitats, including farmland, pasture, landfills, city parks, golf courses, cemeteries, yards, vacant lots, highway turnarounds, feedlots, and the shores of rivers, streams, and marshes. Crows tend to avoid unbroken expanses of forest, but do show up at forest campgrounds and travel into forests along roads and rivers. Avoids deserts.</div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Food</h3>American Crows eat a vast array of foods, including grains, seeds, nuts, fruits, berries, and many kinds of small animals such as earthworms and mice. They eat many insects, including some crop pests, and also eat aquatic animals such as fish, young turtles, crayfish, mussels, and clams. A frequent nest predator, the American Crow eats the eggs and nestlings of many species including sparrows, robins, jays, terns, loons, and eiders. Also eats carrion and garbage.</div>
                    <div><h3>Nesting</h3>Crows typically hide their nests in a crotch near the trunk of a tree or on a horizontal branch, generally towards the top third or quarter of the tree. They prefer to nest in evergreens, but will nest in deciduous trees when evergreens are less available.<br></div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior (det.)</h3>American Crows are highly social birds, more often seen in groups than alone. In addition to roosting and foraging in numbers, crows often stay together in year-round family groups that consist of the breeding pair and offspring from the past two years. The whole family cooperates to raise young. Winter roosts of American Crows sometimes number in the hundreds of thousands. Often admired for their intelligence, American Crows can work together, devise solutions to problems, and recognize unusual sources of food. Some people regard this resourcefulness and sociality as an annoyance when it leads to large flocks around dumpsters, landfills, and roosting sites; others are fascinated by it. American Crows work together to harass or drive off predators, a behavior known as mobbing.</div>
                    <div><h3>Conservation</h3>American Crows are numerous and their populations were stable between 1966 and 2014, according to the North American Breeding Bird Survey. Partners in Flight estimates a global breeding population at 27 million, with 88% spending part of the year in the U.S., and 37% in Canada. They rate a 6 out of 20 on the Continental Concern Score and are not on the </div>
