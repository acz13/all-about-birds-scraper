A denizen of grasslands and other open habitats throughout much of North America, this masked black, white, and gray predator hunts from utility poles, fence posts and other conspicuous perches, preying on insects, birds, lizards, and small mammals. Lacking a raptor’s talons, Loggerhead Shrikes skewer their kills on thorns or barbed wire or wedge them into tight places for easy eating. Their numbers have dropped sharply in the last half-century.</p></div></div><div class="row"><ul class="LH-menu"><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Loggerhead_Shrike/lifehistory#habitat"><span>Habitat</span><span>Open Woodlands</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Loggerhead_Shrike/lifehistory#food"><span>Food</span><span>Insects</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Loggerhead_Shrike/lifehistory#nesting"><span>Nesting</span><span>Tree</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Loggerhead_Shrike/lifehistory#behavior"><span>Behavior</span><span>Aerial Dive</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Loggerhead_Shrike/lifehistory#conservation"><span>Conservation</span><span>Common Bird in Steep Decline</span></a></li></ul></div></div>

                    <div><h3>Size & Shape</h3><p>Loggerhead Shrikes are thick-bodied songbirds. They have large, blocky heads and a thick bill with a small hook. The tail is fairly long and rounded.</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Color Pattern</h3><p>The Loggerhead Shrike is a gray bird with a black mask and white flashes in the black wings. The gray head contrasts with the wide, black mask, black bill, and white throat. The tail is black with white corners; the wings are black with white at the base of the primaries that form a small “handkerchief” spot when the wing is closed and larger white patches in flight. Juveniles have darker barring above and below.</p></div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior</h3><p>Loggerhead Shrikes sit on low, exposed perches and scan for rodents, lizards, birds, and insects. They eat smaller prey (such as ground beetles) right away, but they are famous for impaling larger items on thorns or barbed wire to be eaten later. The species often hovers. When flying it uses bursts of very rapid wingbeats.</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat</h3><p>Open country with scattered shrubs and trees is the typical habitat of Loggerhead Shrike, but the species can also be found in more heavily wooded habitats with large openings and in very short habitats with few or no trees.</p></div>
                </div>
                
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Regional Differences</h3><p>Shrikes from eastern North America have pale to medium-gray rumps. Loggerhead Shrikes from the Interior West have white rumps similar to those of Northern Shrikes. Loggerhead Shrikes breeding in southern California are slightly darker above and much darker below. An endangered subspecies of Loggerhead Shrike from San Clemente Island, in southern California, is the darkest gray of all.</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat (det)</h3>Loggerhead Shrikes inhabit open country with short vegetation and well-spaced shrubs or low trees, particularly those with spines or thorns. They frequent agricultural fields, pastures, old orchards, riparian areas, desert scrublands, savannas, prairies, golf courses, and cemeteries. Loggerhead Shrikes are often seen along mowed roadsides with access to fence lines and utility poles. </div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Food</h3>Loggerhead Shrikes eat insects and other arthropods, amphibians, reptiles, small mammals, and birds; they also sometimes feed on roadkill and carrion. Their staple foods include agricultural pests such as grasshoppers, beetles and rodents. Insects generally dominate the Loggerhead Shrike’s diet during breeding season, while winter brings a greater reliance on vertebrate prey. These include lizards, snakes, frogs, turtles, sparrows, goldfinches, ground squirrels, voles, mice, and shrews, to name just a few.</div>
                    <div><h3>Nesting</h3>Both sexes help find the nest site, inspecting many locations before choosing. Loggerhead Shrikes often build their nests in thorny vegetation, which may help keep predators away. In the absence of trees or shrubs, they sometimes nest in brush piles or tumbleweeds. Average height of nests above the ground ranges from about 2.5–4 feet.<br></div>

                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior (det.)</h3>Loggerhead Shrikes hunt by scanning the ground from elevated perches, then diving onto prey. They also hover-hunt. Loggerhead Shrikes sometimes hunt from the ground, flashing their wing patches in a manner similar to the Northern Mockingbird, to startle prey out of hiding. To immobilize large prey items, the Loggerhead Shrike impales them on sharp objects such as thorns and barbed wire, or tucks them into forks between branches. Caches of prey thus lain away, also called “larders” or “pantries,” provide food stores during winter when prey is scarce, or in breeding season when energy demands are high. A well-provisioned larder may also help a male shrike attract a mate. Loggerhead Shrikes maintain territories largely through songs and displays. Males challenge intruders with a wing-fluttering bow, like an intensified version of their prey-stalking display. Displaying rivals usually face away from one another, but may whirl to face each other or stamp the ground. Before nesting, several neighboring shrikes may gather together and call or display for several minutes. This may help establish territories in the neighborhood, promote pair formation, and help new arrivals find territories near already-established birds. Courting males feed and sing to females, perform a ritual dance, and/or perform a flight display. They are mostly monogamous, although females occasionally raise one brood with one male and then take up with another mate for a second brood the same season.</div>
                    <div><h3>Conservation</h3>Loggerhead Shrikes are still fairly numerous in some areas (particularly the South and West), but their populations have fallen sharply. Between 1966 and 2015, the species declined by almost 3% per year, resulting in a cumulative decline of 76%, according to the North American Breeding Bird Survey. Partners in Flight estimates the global breeding population is 5.8 million, with 82% spending some part of the year in the U.S., 30% in Mexico, and 3% breeding in Canada. The species rates an 11 out of 20 on the Continental Concern Score, and the </div>
