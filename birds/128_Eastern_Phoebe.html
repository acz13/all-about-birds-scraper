These brown-and-white songbirds sit upright and wag their tails from prominent, low perches. They typically place their mud-and-grass nests in protected nooks on bridges, barns, and houses, which adds to the species’ familiarity to humans. Hardy birds, Eastern Phoebes winter farther north than most other flycatchers and are one of the earliest returning migrants in spring. </p></div></div><div class="row"><ul class="LH-menu"><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Eastern_Phoebe/lifehistory#habitat"><span>Habitat</span><span>Open Woodlands</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Eastern_Phoebe/lifehistory#food"><span>Food</span><span>Insects</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Eastern_Phoebe/lifehistory#nesting"><span>Nesting</span><span>Building</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Eastern_Phoebe/lifehistory#behavior"><span>Behavior</span><span>Flycatching</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Eastern_Phoebe/lifehistory#conservation"><span>Conservation</span><span>Low Concern</span></a></li></ul></div></div>

                    <div><h3>Size & Shape</h3><p>The Eastern Phoebe is a plump songbird with a medium-length tail. It appears large-headed for a bird of its size. The head often appears flat on top, but phoebes sometimes raise the feathers up into a peak. Like most small flycatchers, they have short, thin bills used for catching insects. </p></div>
                    <div><h3>Color Pattern</h3><p>The Eastern Phoebe is brownish-gray above and off-white below, with a dusky wash to the sides of the breast. The head is typically the darkest part of the upperparts. Birds in fresh fall plumage show faint yellow on the belly and whitish edging on the folded wing feathers.</p></div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior</h3><p>The Eastern Phoebe generally perches low in trees or on fencelines. Phoebes are very active, making short flights to capture insects and very often returning to the same perch. They make sharp “peep” calls in addition to their familiar “phoebe” vocalizations. When perched, Eastern Phoebes wag their tails down and up frequently.</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat</h3><p> These birds favor open woods such as yards, parks, woodlands, and woodland edges. Phoebes usually breed around buildings or bridges on which they construct their nests under the protection of an eave or ledge.</p></div>
                </div>
                
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Regional Differences</h3>None</div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat (det)</h3>Eastern Phoebes breed in wooded areas (particularly near water sources) that provide nesting sites—typically human-built structures such as eaves of buildings, overhanging decks, bridges, and culverts. Before these sites were common, phoebes nested on bare rock outcrops and still do occasionally. They seem to choose nest sites with woody understory vegetation nearby, possibly to make the nest site less visible or to provide perches near the nest for the adult. On migration they use wooded habitats and show somewhat less of an association with water. During winter, Eastern Phoebes occur in deciduous woods, more often near woodland edges and openings than in unbroken forests. </div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Food</h3>Flying insects make up the majority of the Eastern Phoebe’s diet. Common prey include wasps, beetles, dragonflies, butterflies and moths, flies, midges, and cicadas; they also eat spiders, ticks, and millipedes, as well as occasional small fruits or seeds. </div>
                    <div><h3>Nesting</h3>Eastern Phoebes build nests in niches or under overhangs, where the young will be protected from the elements and fairly safe from predators. They avoid damp crevices and seem to prefer the nests to be close to the roof of whatever alcove they have chosen. Nests are typically less than 15 feet from the ground (in a few cases they have been built below ground level, in a well or cistern).<br></div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior (det.)</h3>Eastern Phoebes sit alertly on low perches, often twitching their tails as they look out for flying insects. When they spot one, they abruptly leave their perch on quick wingbeats, and chase down their prey in a quick sally—often returning to the same or a nearby perch. Less often, they hover to pick insects or seeds from foliage. Phoebes rarely occur in groups, and even mated pairs spend little time together. Males sing their two-parted, raspy song throughout the spring and aggressively defend their territory from others of their Eastern Phoebes, though they tolerate other species. Both sexes, but particularly the female, attempt to defend the nest against such predators as snakes, jays, crows, chipmunks, mice, and House Wrens.</div>
                    <div><h3>Conservation</h3>Eastern Phoebe populations were stable overall between 1966 and 2015, with small declines in Canada, and small increases in the U.S., according to the North American Breeding Bird Survey. Partners in Flight estimates a global breeding population of 32 million with 76% spending some part of the year in the U.S., 33% wintering in Mexico, and 24% breeding in Canada. The species rates an 8 out of 20 on the Continental Concern Score. Eastern Phoebe is not on the </div>
