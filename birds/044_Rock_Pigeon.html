In addition to the typical blue-gray bird with two dark wingbars, you'll often see flocks with plain, spotted, pale, or rusty-red birds in them. Introduced to North America from Europe in the early 1600s, city pigeons nest on buildings and window ledges. In the countryside they also nest on barns and grain towers, under bridges, and on natural cliffs.</p></div></div><div class="row"><ul class="LH-menu"><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Rock_Pigeon/lifehistory#habitat"><span>Habitat</span><span>Towns</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Rock_Pigeon/lifehistory#food"><span>Food</span><span>Seeds</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Rock_Pigeon/lifehistory#nesting"><span>Nesting</span><span>Building</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Rock_Pigeon/lifehistory#behavior"><span>Behavior</span><span>Ground Forager</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Rock_Pigeon/lifehistory#conservation"><span>Conservation</span><span>Low Concern</span></a></li></ul></div></div>

                    <div><h3>Size & Shape</h3><p>Larger and plumper than a Mourning Dove, Rock Pigeons are tubby birds with small heads and short legs. Their wings are broad but pointed wings and the tail is wide and rounded.</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Color Pattern</h3><p>Variable in color, but most birds are bluish gray with two black bands on the wing and a black tip to the tail. Most birds have iridescent throat feathers. Wing patterns may include two bars, dark spots, or can be plain. The tail is usually dark tipped.</p></div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior</h3><p>Pigeons often gather in flocks, walking or running on the ground and pecking for food. When alarmed, the flock may suddenly fly into the air and circle several times before coming down again.</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat</h3><p>Pigeons are familiar birds of cities and towns. You'll also see them around farmland and fields, as well as in their archetypal habitat, rocky cliffs.</p></div>
                </div>
                
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Regional Differences</h3><p>Rock Pigeons with red plumage may be more common in the southwestern United States than in northern and eastern areas.</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat (det)</h3>Urban areas, farmland, and rocky cliffs. May gather in large flocks in urban parks where people feed them.</div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Food</h3>Seeds, fruits, rarely invertebrates. Pigeons also readily eat food intentionally or unintentionally left by people, including bread crumbs and littered food.</div>
                    <div><h3>Nesting</h3>Males typically choose the nest site, then sit in place and coo to attract a mate. The site is a nook, cranny, or ledge on either cliffs or manmade structures, often beneath eaves or an overhang. Pigeons may nest in stairwells, in rooms of abandoned buildings, or rain gutters.<br></div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior (det.)</h3>Pigeons peck at food on the ground and drink by placing their bill in water, using it like a straw. When threatening a rival, pigeons may bow and coo, inflating their throat and walking in a circle. A male pigeon courts his mate by bowing, cooing, inflating his throat, and strutting in a circle around the female. The pair may preen one another and the male may grasp the femaleâ€™s bill, regurgitating food as a courtship gesture. When ready to mate, the female crouches and the males jumps on her back. The male brings one twig or stem at a time to the female to build a nest. He incubates the eggs from mid-morning to late afternoon; she takes her turn in late afternoon and overnight to mid-morning. Both parents brood the young and feed them by regurgitating a milky liquid secreted by the lining of the birds' crops.</div>
                    <div><h3>Conservation</h3>Rock Pigeons are abundant and widespread, so it may come as a surprize to learn that North American populations declined by 46% between 1966 and 2015, according to the North American Breeding Bird Survey. Partners in Flight estimates a global breeding population of 120 million with 7% living in the U.S., 2% in Canada, and 2% in Mexico. The species rates a 6 out of 20 on the Continental Concern Score.
