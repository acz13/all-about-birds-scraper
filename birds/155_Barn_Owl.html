Lanky, with a whitish face, chest, and belly, and buffy upperparts, this owl roosts in hidden, quiet places during the day. By night, they hunt on buoyant wingbeats in open fields and meadows. You can find them by listening for their eerie, raspy calls, quite unlike the hoots of other owls. Despite a worldwide distribution, Barn Owls are declining in parts of their range due to habitat loss.</p></div></div><div class="row"><ul class="LH-menu"><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Barn_Owl/lifehistory#habitat"><span>Habitat</span><span>Grasslands</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Barn_Owl/lifehistory#food"><span>Food</span><span>Mammals</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Barn_Owl/lifehistory#nesting"><span>Nesting</span><span>Building</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Barn_Owl/lifehistory#behavior"><span>Behavior</span><span>Aerial Dive</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Barn_Owl/lifehistory#conservation"><span>Conservation</span><span>Low Concern</span></a></li></ul></div></div>

                    <div><h3>Size & Shape</h3><p>These medium-sized owls have long, rounded wings and short tails, which combine with a buoyant, loping flight to give them a distinctive flight style. The legs are long and the head is smoothly rounded, without ear tufts.</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Color Pattern</h3><p>Barn Owls are pale overall with dark eyes. They have a mix of buff and gray on the head, back, and upperwings, and are white on the face, body, and underwings. When seen at night they can appear all white.</p></div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior</h3><p>Barn Owls nest and roost in cavities, abandoned barns and other buildings, and dense trees. At night, Barn Owls hunt by flying low, back and forth over open habitats, searching for small rodents primarily by sound. </p></div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat</h3><p>Barn Owls require large areas of open land over which to hunt. This can either be marsh, grasslands, or mixed agricultural fields. For nesting and roosting, they prefer quiet cavities, either in trees or man-made structures such as barns or silos.</p></div>
                </div>
                
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Regional Differences</h3><p>Barn Owls have a worldwide distribution with substantial variation in size and in the patterns of buff and white in the plumage. However, the subspecies found in the United States and Canada does not show substantial geographic variation.</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat (det)</h3>Barn Owls live in open habitats across most of the lower 48 United States and extend into a few parts of southern Canada (as well as in much of the rest of the world). These include grasslands, deserts, marshes, agricultural fields, strips of forest, woodlots, ranchlands, brushy fields, and suburbs and cities. They nest in tree cavities, caves, and in buildings (often barns but also including Yankee Stadium). In the Andes they occur as high as 13,000 feet elevation. </div>

                <div>
                    <div><h3>Food</h3>Barn Owls eat mostly small mammals, particularly rats, mice, voles, lemmings, and other rodents; also shrews, bats, and rabbits. Most of the prey they eat are active at night, so squirrels and chipmunks are relatively safe from Barn Owls. They occasionally eat birds such as starlings, blackbirds, and meadowlarks. Nesting Barn Owls sometimes store dozens of prey items at the nest site while they are incubating to feed the young once they hatch. </div>
                    <div><h3>Nesting</h3>Barn Owls put their nests in holes in trees, cliff ledges and crevices, caves, burrows in river banks, and in many kinds of human structures, including barn lofts, church steeples, houses, nest boxes, haystacks, and even drive-in movie screens.<br></div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior (det.)</h3>Barn Owls fly slowly over open fields at night or dusk with slow wingbeats and a looping, buoyant flight. They use their impressive hearing, aided by their satellite-dish-shaped faces, to locate mice and other rodents in the grass, often in complete darkness. Barn Owls are usually monogamous and mate for life, although there are some reports of males with more than one mate. Males attract their mates with several kinds of display flights, including a “moth flight” where he hovers in front of a female for several seconds, his feet dangling. He also displays potential nest sites by calling and flying in and out of the nest. After the pair forms, the male brings prey to the female (often more than she can consume), beginning about a month before she starts laying eggs. Barn Owls defend the area around their nests, but don’t defend their hunting sites; more than one pair may hunt on the same fields. </div>
                    <div><h3>Conservation</h3>Barn Owls are difficult to count because they're nocturnal and secretive, so population sizes are hard to estimate. Owing in part to this difficulty, the North American Breeding Bird Survey could not detect a significant population change between 1966 and 2014, although it appears that their numbers have slightly increased in that time. Partners in Flight estimates a global breeding population of 2 million, with 7% living in the U.S. and 2% in Mexico. They rate a 9 out of 20 on the Continental Concern Score and are not on the </div>
