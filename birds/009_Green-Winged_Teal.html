The natty male has a cinnamon-colored head with a gleaming green crescent that extends from the eye to the back of the head. In flight, both sexes flash deep-green wing patches (specula). Look for them on shallow ponds and in flooded fields, and listen for the male’s decidedly non-ducklike whistle. These common ducks breed along northern rivers; wintering flocks can number as many as 50,000. </p></div></div><div class="row"><ul class="LH-menu"><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Green-winged_Teal/lifehistory#habitat"><span>Habitat</span><span>Marshes</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Green-winged_Teal/lifehistory#food"><span>Food</span><span>Seeds</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Green-winged_Teal/lifehistory#nesting"><span>Nesting</span><span>Ground</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Green-winged_Teal/lifehistory#behavior"><span>Behavior</span><span>Dabbler</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Green-winged_Teal/lifehistory#conservation"><span>Conservation</span><span>Low Concern</span></a></li></ul></div></div>

                    <div><h3>Size & Shape</h3><p>Green-winged Teal are very small ducks. They have short, blocky bodies and their tails sit high out of the water. The head is large, the neck is short, and the bill is relatively small.</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Color Pattern</h3><p>Adult males have grayish bodies with a narrow white vertical stripe extending from the waterline to the shoulder. In good light, their dark heads are cinnamon with a wide green swoop from the eye to the back of the neck. Females are brown with a yellowish streak along the tail. Both sexes have green wing patches in the secondaries (speculum), but these may be hidden when not in flight.</p></div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior</h3><p>Green-winged Teal are dabbling ducks that feed on vegetation by tipping up in shallow water or by picking at food items while standing in puddles, flooded fields, and margins of wetlands.</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat</h3><p>Green-winged Teal feed on shallow bodies of water and in flooded fields. They breed in dense vegetation along river deltas. During migration and winter, look for them on shallow wetlands, coastal marshes and estuaries.</p></div>
                </div>
                
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Regional Differences</h3><p>In Europe and Asia, a form of the Green-winged Teal (often called Common Teal) lacks the male’s white vertical stripe on the breast and instead shows a white horizontal stripe on the shoulder. Another subspecies from the Aleutian Islands shares these markings with “Common” Teal.</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat (det)</h3>Green-winged Teal breed mostly in isolated river deltas, forest wetlands, and mixed prairie regions across northern North America—they occur in the prairie pothole region, but they are not as restricted to it as many other dabbling ducks. Nesting sites include grasslands or sedge meadows that provide brush thickets of sedge or cattail for cover, and weedy or burned areas. They also favor beaver ponds in wooded areas, and nest along streams, potholes, lakes, and human-made wetlands. The race living on the Aleutian Islands nests near shallow, weedy ponds, saltwater shorelines, and beaches. Migrating birds stop over in shallow wetlands, coastal marshes, and flooded fields. Wintering birds typically flock to shallow wetlands, including coastal marshes and bayous, estuaries, the playa lakes of Texas’s southern high plains, riparian sloughs, and agricultural areas such as rice fields. The nonmigratory Aleutian race of Alaska winters along the islands’ beaches.</div>

                <div>
                    <div><h3>Food</h3>Green-winged Teal eat mainly aquatic invertebrates and seeds. They feed in shallow water, near shorelines, on mudflats, and in agricultural fields, taking advantage of whatever foods are most abundant. Migrating and wintering birds may feed at night or during the day. On the water they dabble along the surface where they pluck or strain seeds and invertebrates, and dip their head and neck or tip up to reach submerged food. They also probe mudflats for invertebrates and eat worms, seed shrimp, and copepods living just above the sediment. Depending on where they’re feeding, plant foods may include sedge fruit, seeds of pondweeds, grasses, smartweeds, sea purslane, bulrush, dwarf spikerush, swamp timothy, and agricultural crops including corn and rice. Animal prey includes midges, tadpoles, molluscs, and crustaceans. Chicks up to 2 weeks old eat mainly insect larvae.</div>
                    <div><h3>Nesting</h3>With the male following behind, the female chooses a well-concealed site on the ground, usually within about 200 yards of water. Nests are typically built in sedge meadows, grasslands, brush thickets, or in woods near a pond. The female chooses a spot that offers dense cover that may form a complete canopy over the nest.<br></div>

                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior (det.)</h3>Green-winged Teal are fast, agile, buoyant flyers. They can take off straight from the water without running across the surface. Though they are dabbling ducks that usually tip up to feed, they occasionally dive for food and to avoid predators. In winter Green-winged Teal gather in roosting flocks of up to 50,000 birds. Courtship starts in the fall and peaks in January and February; they choose new partners each year. Males try to secure a mate using an elaborate set of movements and vocal displays, with groups of up to 25 males courting females both on the water and in courtship flights. Although most pairs form on the wintering grounds, pair formation continues during spring migration and on the breeding grounds. The male defends its mate from copulation attempts by other males, then deserts the female once incubation is underway. A few hours after they hatch the chicks can swim, dive, walk, and forage for themselves, although the female continues to brood them at night and to protect them when the weather turns cold. </div>
                    <div><h3>Conservation</h3>Green-winged Teal are numerous and their population has increased over recent decades, according to waterfowl surveys by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. They estimated the North American breeding population in 2015 was at least 4 million, almost double the long-term average. Green-winged Teal are not on the </div>
