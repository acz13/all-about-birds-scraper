It's one of the most colorful of all raptors: the male’s slate-blue head and wings contrast elegantly with his rusty-red back and tail; the female has the same warm reddish on her wings, back, and tail. Hunting for insects and other small prey in open territory, kestrels perch on wires or poles, or hover facing into the wind, flapping and adjusting their long tails to stay in place. Kestrels are declining in parts of their range; you can help them by putting up nest boxes.</p></div></div><div class="row"><ul class="LH-menu"><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/American_Kestrel/lifehistory#habitat"><span>Habitat</span><span>Grasslands</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/American_Kestrel/lifehistory#food"><span>Food</span><span>Small Animals</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/American_Kestrel/lifehistory#nesting"><span>Nesting</span><span>Cavity</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/American_Kestrel/lifehistory#behavior"><span>Behavior</span><span>Aerial Dive</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/American_Kestrel/lifehistory#conservation"><span>Conservation</span><span>Low Concern</span></a></li></ul></div></div>

                    <div><h3>Size & Shape</h3><p>The slender American Kestrel is roughly the size and shape of a Mourning Dove, although it has a larger head; longer, narrow wings; and long, square-tipped tail. In flight, the wings are often bent and the wingtips swept back.</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Color Pattern</h3><p>American Kestrels are pale when seen from below and warm, rusty brown spotted with black above, with a black band near the tip of the tail. Males have slate-blue wings; females’ wings are reddish brown. Both sexes have pairs of black vertical slashes on the sides of their pale faces—sometimes called a “mustache” and a “sideburn." </p></div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior</h3><p>American Kestrels usually snatch their victims from the ground, though some catch quarry on the wing. They are gracefully buoyant in flight, and are small enough to get tossed around in the wind. When perched, kestrels often pump their tails as if they are trying to balance. </p></div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat</h3><p>American Kestrels occupy habitats ranging from deserts and grasslands to alpine meadows. You’re most likely to see them perching on telephone wires along roadsides, in open country with short vegetation and few trees.</p></div>
                </div>
                
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Regional Differences</h3>None</div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat (det)</h3>American Kestrels favor open areas with short ground vegetation and sparse trees. You’ll find them in meadows, grasslands, deserts, parks, farm fields, cities, and suburbs. The southeastern U.S. form breeds in unusual longleaf pine sandhill habitat. When breeding, kestrels need access to at least a few trees or structures that provide appropriate nesting cavities. American Kestrels are attracted to many habitats modified by humans, including pastures and parkland, and are often found near areas of human activity including towns and cities. </div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Food</h3>American Kestrels eat mostly insects and other invertebrates, as well as small rodents and birds. Common foods include grasshoppers, cicadas, beetles, and dragonflies; scorpions and spiders; butterflies and moths; voles, mice, shrews, bats, and small songbirds. American Kestrels also sometimes eat small snakes, lizards, and frogs. And some people have reported seeing American Kestrels take larger prey, including red squirrels and Northern Flickers. </div>
                    <div><h3>Nesting</h3>American Kestrels nest in cavities, although they lack the ability to excavate their own. They rely on old woodpecker holes, natural tree hollows, rock crevices, and nooks in buildings and other human-built structures. The male searches for possible nest cavities. When he’s found suitable candidates, he shows them to the female, who makes the final choice. Typically, nest sites are in trees along wood edges or in the middle of open ground. American Kestrels take readily to nest boxes (see Backyard Tips).<br></div>

                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior (det.)</h3>American Kestrels normally hunt by day. You may see a kestrel scanning for prey from the same perch all day long—or changing perches every few minutes. A kestrel pounces on its prey, seizing it with one or both feet; the bird may finish off a small meal right there on the ground, or carry larger prey back to a perch. During breeding season, males advertise their territory by repeatedly climbing and then diving, uttering a short series of </div>
                    <div><h3>Conservation</h3><p>The American Kestrel is the continent’s most common and widespread falcon, but populations declined by an estimated 1.39% per year between 1966 and 2017, according to the <a href="https://www.mbr-pwrc.usgs.gov/bbs/specl15.html">North American Breeding Bird Survey</a>. That annual trend corresponds to a 51% cumulative decline over the full period. <a href="http://pif.birdconservancy.org/ACAD/Database.aspx">Partners in Flight</a> estimates the global breeding population at 9.2 million. The species rates a 10 out of 20 on the <a href="http://www.stateofthebirds.org/2016/overview/methods/">Continental Concern Score</a>, indicating a species of relatively low conservation concern. Nevertheless, if current trends continue, American Kestrels will lose another 50% of their population by 2075. Current declines stem from continued clearing of land and felling of the standing dead trees these birds depend on for their nest sites. The American Kestrel is also losing prey sources and nesting cavities to so-called “clean” farming practices, which remove hedgerows, trees, and brush. An additional threat is exposure to pesticides and other pollutants, which can reduce clutch sizes and hatching success. For kestrels in North America, a larger problem with pesticides is that they destroy the insects, spiders, and other prey on which the birds depend.</p></div>
