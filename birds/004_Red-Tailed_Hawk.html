If you’ve got sharp eyes you’ll see several individuals on almost any long car ride, anywhere. Red-tailed Hawks soar above open fields, slowly turning circles on their broad, rounded wings. Other times you’ll see them atop telephone poles, eyes fixed on the ground to catch the movements of a vole or a rabbit, or simply waiting out cold weather before climbing a thermal updraft into the sky.</p></div></div><div class="row"><ul class="LH-menu"><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Red-tailed_Hawk/lifehistory#habitat"><span>Habitat</span><span>Open Woodlands</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Red-tailed_Hawk/lifehistory#food"><span>Food</span><span>Small Animals</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Red-tailed_Hawk/lifehistory#nesting"><span>Nesting</span><span>Tree</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Red-tailed_Hawk/lifehistory#behavior"><span>Behavior</span><span>Soaring</span></a></li><li><a class="text-label" href="/guide/Red-tailed_Hawk/lifehistory#conservation"><span>Conservation</span><span>Low Concern</span></a></li></ul></div></div>

                    <div><h3>Size & Shape</h3><p>Red-tailed Hawks are large hawks with typical <em>Buteo</em> proportions: very broad, rounded wings and a short, wide tail. Large females seen from a distance might fool you into thinking you’re seeing an eagle. (Until an actual eagle comes along.)</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Color Pattern</h3><p>Most Red-tailed Hawks are rich brown above and pale below, with a streaked belly and, on the wing underside, a dark bar between shoulder and wrist. The tail is usually pale below and cinnamon-red above, though in young birds it’s brown and banded. “Dark-morph” birds are all chocolate-brown with a warm red tail. “Rufous-morph” birds are reddish-brown on the chest with a dark belly.</p></div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior</h3><p>You’ll most likely see Red-tailed Hawks soaring in wide circles high over a field. When flapping, their wingbeats are heavy. In high winds they may face into the wind and hover without flapping, eyes fixed on the ground. They attack in a slow, controlled dive with legs outstretched – much different from a falcon’s stoop.</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat</h3><p>The Red-tailed Hawk is a bird of open country. Look for it along fields and perched on telephones poles, fenceposts, or trees standing alone or along edges of fields.</p></div>
                </div>
                
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Regional Differences</h3><p>Red-tailed Hawks have extremely variable plumage, and some of this variation is regional. A Great Plains race called "Krider's" hawk is pale, with a whitish head and washed-out pink in the tail. Light-morph western birds tend to be more streaky on the underparts than eastern Red-tails; south Texas forms are darker above, without the dark belly band most other Red-tails have. Dark-morph birds can occur anywhere but are more common in western North America - particularly in Alaska and northwest Canada, where the all-dark "Harlan's" race is common.</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat (det)</h3>Red-tailed Hawks occupy just about every type of open habitat on the continent. This includes desert, scrublands, grasslands, roadsides, fields and pastures, parks, broken woodland, and (in Mexico) tropical rainforest.</div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Food</h3>Mammals make up the bulk of most Red-tailed Hawk meals. Frequent victims include voles, mice, wood rats, rabbits, snowshoe hares, jackrabbits, and ground squirrels. The hawks also eat birds, including pheasants, bobwhite, starlings, and blackbirds; as well as snakes and carrion. Individual prey items can weigh anywhere from less than an ounce to more than 5 pounds.</div>
                    <div><h3>Nesting</h3>Red-tailed Hawks typically put their nests in the crowns of tall trees where they have a commanding view of the landscape. They may also nest on a cliff ledge or on artificial structures such as window ledges and billboard platforms.<br></div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior (det.)</h3>Red-tailed Hawks are large, sharp-taloned birds that can be aggressive when defending nests or territories. They frequently chase off other hawks, eagles, and Great Horned Owls. Courting birds fly with legs hanging beneath them, or chase and swoop after each other, sometimes locking talons (see Cool Facts). Mated pairs typically stay together until one of the pair dies.</div>
                    <div><h3>Conservation</h3>Red-tailed Hawk populations increased throughout much of their range between 1966 and 2015, according to the North American Breeding Bird Survey. Partners in Flight estimates a global breeding population of 2.3 million with 75% spending some part of the year in the U.S., 24% in Canada, and 21% in Mexico. The species rates a 6 out of 20 on the Continental Concern Score. Red-tailed Hawk is not on the </div>
