This husky, barrel-chested flycatcher is the largest of the pewees, with heavy grayish markings on the sides as if the bird is wearing a waistcoat. Olive-sided Flycatchers are vigorous defenders of their territory and nest, chasing rivals and predators with the fervor of a kingbird. Look for them singing from open perches in the highest parts of live or dead trees. These birds are also fairly common in recently burned forests.</p>

                    <div><h3>Size & Shape</h3><p><p>A stocky, barrel-chested flycatcher, with a large head and a heavy, long bill for its size. It has rather long wings that can make the tail look short.</p>
</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Color Pattern</h3><p><p>Sooty gray-brown above (with olive tones only in optimal light and fresh plumage), paler below. The dark gray sides of the breast contrast with white in the center, making it look as if the bird is wearing a vest. From the rear, large white tufts at the sides of the back are sometimes visible.</p>
</p></div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior</h3><p><p>Olive-sided Flycatchers spend much of their time perched high in trees, watching for large flying insects. They catch these insects by sallying—flying out in quick pursuit, seizing the prey in its bill, and returning to the same perch.</p>
</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat</h3><p><p>Breeds mostly in northern and montane coniferous forest from sea level to timberline and the edge of the tundra. They are most numerous in mid- and higher-elevation forest in mountains (3,000–7,000 feet elevation) and around burned or boggy areas with numerous openings and dead trees. Migrants and wintering birds also favor gaps in coniferous forest.</p>
</p></div>
                </div>
                
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Regional Differences</h3><p><p>A subspecies known as <em>majorinus </em>breeds in southern California and northern Baja California. These individuals have longer wings and tails than Olive-sided Flycatchers in the rest of the range.</p>
</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat (det)</h3><p>Olive-sided Flycatchers breed mostly in the boreal forest and in western coniferous forests, from sea level to over 10,000 feet elevation in some parts of the Rockies. Here they are found in forests of spruce, fir, Douglas-fir, hemlock, western redcedar, and tamarack or larch. In southern California and northern Baja California (home to subspecies <em>majorinus</em>), they inhabit mostly pine forest. In all nesting areas, they use openings or edges in the forest and are rarely found in deep, closed forest—look for them in meadows, rivers and streams, partially logged areas, recent burns, beaver ponds, bogs, and muskegs. These areas often have dead or dying trees, which provide exposed perches for singing, foraging, and watching for predators and rivals. Nesting sites near water also provide a great abundance of aerial insects, their chief food. In the easternmost edges of their range, Olive-sided Flycatchers sometimes nest in small towns or on farms, even in apple orchards. In southwestern British Columbia, they occur in stands of Garry oak, which is an increasingly endangered habitat there. On migration, they can show up in almost any habitat with trees, but are more likely to be seen in semi-open forested areas along waterways or bodies of water, with at least a few dead trees present. On the wintering grounds in Central and South America, Olive-sided Flycatchers use forest with gaps and edges as well, in both lowland and highland forest. Water appears to be a less important component of nonbreeding habitat, but scattered tall trees with snags are almost always present.</p></div>

                <div>
                    <div><h3>Food</h3><p>Olive-sided Flycatchers eat flying insects, most of which they capture in flight, including flying ants, wasps, bees, dragonflies, grasshoppers, beetles, moths, and flies. They may occasionally eat fruit (berries) during migration or during the nonbreeding season, as other large flycatchers do, but observations are lacking.</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Nesting</h3><p>As is true of many flycatchers, the female chooses the nest site, but males sometimes participate. Nests are usually on a horizontal branch, well away from the trunk and toward the tip. Nests in the northern and eastern parts of range tend to be lower, those in the West higher in the tree. The lowest nest on record was 5 feet off the ground, the highest 197 feet. Most nests are placed in coniferous trees (sometimes in burned, dead conifers), but nests in aspen, willow, oak, sycamore, alder, cottonwood, elm, and locust are also documented.</p><br></div>

                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior (det.)</h3><p>Pewees (in the genus <em>Contopus</em>) are active, agile flycatchers; Olive-sided Flycatchers are the giants of this group, more than twice as heavy as Eastern and Western Wood-Pewees. When chasing a rival or a predator, in flying out to take an insect on the wing, their flight is strong, rapid, and direct, recalling the flight of larger kingbirds. The species is highly territorial, often with large territories—sometimes in excess of 100 acres. Territories often do not abut one another but instead are separated by areas of unsuitable habitat. When courting, males may chase females through the territory and perform a short display flight, which the female may join. Breeding males drive out rival males from the territory in swift aerial chases. Once the rival is expelled, the nesting pair reunites, raising crest feathers, clicking bills, and pumping tails and bodies. The pair bond in this species appears to be strong and can survive failed nestings and renesting attempts. At least two cases are known in which a pair nested in consecutive years. Unlike many Nearctic migrants, wintering Olive-sided Flycatchers in Central and South America also hold and defend territories from others of their species. They are rarely found among mixed-species flocks.</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Conservation</h3><p>Olive-sided Flycatcher populations are in decline. According to <a href="http://pif.birdconservancy.org/ACAD/Database.aspx">Partners in Flight</a>, their numbers have fallen by 79% since 1970, with the remaining breeding population estimated at 1.9 million. The species rates a 13 out of 20 on the <a href="http://www.stateofthebirds.org/2016/overview/methods/">Continental Concern Score</a> and is on the <a href="https://www.partnersinflight.org/watch-list-categories/">Yellow Watch List</a> for declining populations. Declines may be due to a loss of wintering habitat. This species takes advantage of high insect numbers and good foraging conditions in recently burned forests, and may be adversely impacted by fire suppression and salvage logging.</p></div>
