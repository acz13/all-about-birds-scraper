Although this stork doesn't bring babies, it is a good flier, soaring on thermals with neck and legs outstretched. This bald-headed wading bird stands just over 3 feet tall, towering above almost all other wetland birds. It slowly walks through wetlands with its long, hefty bill down in the water feeling for fish and crustaceans. This ungainly looking stork roosts and nests in colonies in trees above standing water.</p>

                    <div><h3>Size & Shape</h3><p><p>Wood Storks are hefty wading birds with football-shaped bodies perched atop long legs. They have a long neck and a long, thick bill that is curved at the tip. They fly with their neck and legs outstretched but tend to perch with the neck drawn in, giving them a humpbacked appearance. </p>
</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Color Pattern</h3><p><p>Wood Storks are entirely white save for their black flight feathers and tail. The head is unfeathered and scaly-looking. </p>
</p></div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior</h3><p><p>Wood Storks frequently feed in groups with their heads down feeling for prey in open wetlands. Within the group, they often feed in lines—one after the other. They fly with head and legs outstretched, soaring on thermals high into the sky like a raptor or vulture.</p>
</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat</h3><p><p>Wood Storks breed in fresh and brackish forested wetlands. They forage in wetlands, swamps, ponds, and marshes, especially those with an open canopy. </p>
</p></div>
                </div>

                    <div><h3>Regional Differences</h3>None</div>
                    <div><h3>Habitat (det)</h3><p>Wood Storks breed in fresh and brackish forested wetlands. They forage in wetlands, swamps, ponds, and marshes with water depths of around 4–12 inches. They tend to use open wetlands more frequently for foraging than closed canopy wetlands. Storks roost in trees along the water's edge.</p></div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div><h3>Food</h3><p>Wood Storks primarily eat fish and other aquatic invertebrates, but sometimes take seeds, amphibians, nestlings, and reptiles. They walk slowly through wetlands with their bill in the water, feeling for prey. When they feel something on their bill, they quickly snap it closed, swallowing the prey whole. To find prey they also push their feet up and down in the water or flick their wings to startle prey. Storks also visually search for prey, but more frequently use their bill to feel for it, especially in muddy waters.</p></div>
                    <div><h3>Nesting</h3><p>Wood Storks nest in trees above standing water. They build nests in cypress swamps, in oaks in flooded impoundments, in mangroves, and in flooded areas with black gum and Australian pine. Almost any tree or shrub will do as long as standing water is present.</p><br></div>

                <div>
                    <div><h3>Behavior (det.)</h3><p>Wood Storks are social birds that forage in groups and nest in colonies. Small groups of storks forage in wetlands, frequently following each other one by one in a line. In the late afternoon, when temperatures rise, Wood Storks often take to the sky, soaring on thermals like raptors. They nest in tight colonies with egrets and herons and generally show little aggression, but if a bird or mammal threatens them, they may pull their neck in, fluff up their feathers, and walk toward the intruder. Threats are also met with bill clattering and jabbing. Despite the myth that Wood Storks mate for life, pairs form at the breeding colony and stay together only for a single breeding season. Males initially are hostile to the female, but once he accepts her into the territory he starts preening her and offering her sticks. </p></div>
                    <div><h3>Conservation</h3><p>Wood Storks are uncommon in the United States. Their populations remained stable from 1966 to 2015, according to the<a href="https://www.mbr-pwrc.usgs.gov/bbs/specl15.html"> North American Breeding Bird Survey</a>. <a href="http://pif.birdconservancy.org/ACAD/Database.aspx">Partners in Flight</a> estimates the global breeding population at 450,000. The species rates a 12 out of 20 on the <a href="http://www.stateofthebirds.org/2016/overview/methods/">Continental Concern Score</a>, which means it is not on the<a href="https://www.partnersinflight.org/watch-list-categories/"> Partners in Flight Watch List</a> and is a species of low conservation concern. However, because Wood Storks occur only in a small portion of the United States, the <a href="https://www.fws.gov/northflorida/woodstorks/wood-storks.htm">U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service lists them as federally threatened</a>. Wood Stork populations are vulnerable to changes in water levels. During dry years or in years when extensive water diversion projects reduce the amount of standing water below nest trees, a colony may forgo nesting. Low water levels can also increase nest predation from terrestrial predators such as raccoons. Lower water levels also affect foraging opportunities as fewer prey are available.</p></div>
